# Notes

This is where I store all the concepts, and all the knowledge bricks I acquire while reading, listening to podcasts, having a conversation, etc. There will be notes about every subject possible in here, and they won't necessarily be sorted. If I see that a lot of notes accumulate on the same subject, I may make a separate Map of Content for them.

### Raw Notes :
Here, you can view my raw notes. Some may contain sensitive and/or controversial topics. They are meant to be re-read by myself so I can eventually elaborate them further and turn them into articles. I will be talking about every topics you can imagine, without filters. Some of them may contain, or even only contain Highlights, which could be in French.
