Here are all the notes that didn't fit in the MOC I use.

The Raw [[notes]]# may be messy, because they are meant to be re-read by myself so I can later turn them into permanent notes. They will often be filled with **Highlights**, which are the "interesting parts" I want to save in my memory when I read/listen to something. Thus, they can be in other languages such as French.

If you feel like what I am saying in these is incorrect, feel free to send me an e-mail so I can review what I wrote and potentially reformulate/correct what is said in there. (See [[myself]])

Finally, as I previously said, 

> I do not pretend owning any of the stuff I write here, it is simply a database of my knowledge, so feel free to re-use it.
