This is a no-bullshit, practical guide made for young men who want to improve their lives. I will try to be as quick and precise as possible.

Sometimes, I will be “mean”. I will explain the reason for that later, but for now, you have to understand something: if you feel offended by something I say, I'm probably talking about you. You can't trust your brain, because it's the reason you are here today.  Trust me instead.

I made this guide because I felt lonely. This is my attempt at helping other men so I'm not the only one I know working on himself anymore. I started writing this guide when I was 15, only a few months into self-improvement.

# How to use this guide

**It is made for you if:**
- You are anywhere between 13 and 30.
- You don't have the life you want.
- You want to improve.

**This guide will have “Practical Steps”**, which are steps you **have to** follow for it to work. You can't expect **any** results if you don't follow each one of them. You will also need to read each paragraph, sentence, and word, without skipping any. If I wrote something, it means it's important. I don't even make money out of this, (there are no ads) so that's how you know you can trust me.

I don't recommend you skip chapters, because I put them in this specific order for a reason. Every chapter completes every other: they're all essential to each other. In other words, **don't skip anything the first time you read this**. If you have already finished this guide, and you just forgot something and wanted to read it again, no problem. That's why I made this Table of Contents.

You aren't supposed to read the whole document in 2 days. Take a few days to apply every single thing you learn while reading this Guide, and you will be so ahead of everyone else.
# How to start on Self Improvement

Firstly, let's define self-improvement.  
> Self-improvement is **the improvement of one's knowledge, status, or character by one's own efforts**. It's the quest to make ourselves better in any and every facet of life.
([Source](https://jamesclear.com/))

I see it as a community of young men who want to improve themselves every day to follow their purpose.

## SECTION 1: Mental Health Guide

This section is overlooked by the majority of people in self-improvement. But it is the starting point, the foundation of your physical, financial, and social success. Please don't skip it, it's probably the most important one.

It is what determines your productivity, discipline, willpower, your ability to resist your addictions, and many more. Chances are, you probably have a fucked up mental health right now. Maybe you've tried to consistently go to the gym or to stop watching porn. And you probably failed. That's because you don't have good mental health. 

Let's improve it.

### Taking the NHS

> Actionable Step!

Firstly, let's test your current mental health. Take [this NHS Mental Health test](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/depression-anxiety-self-assessment-quiz/) (as always, I don't make any money if you click this link, it is the official UK's mental health test). At the end of the quiz, you will be given two scores out of 20 for your Depression, and Anxiety. Save them somewhere you know you will be able to find them back. (Message yourself a screenshot of the results, put it on Google Drive, and save it in your Gallery…). This will allow you to compare your scores before and after you implement in your life what this guide tells you to do.

So, how much did you get? If you scored more than a couple of points, let's say 5, you probably need to follow this guide. 

There are two main reasons why you didn't get a good score. The first one is trauma, and the second one is what I call “not behaving *normally*”.

Let's talk about trauma first

Trauma is any event that was extremely painful or scary (often in childhood). It could be your parents shouting at you when you were younger (or still to this day), for example. If you've had a traumatic event, you will experience stress for a long time for anything related to this. Someone who was run over by a car may experience post-traumatic stress whenever he crosses the road.

Now let's talk about "not behaving *normally*". It means not living like a healthy, natural human being. Not living like you are supposed to live. If you spend countless hours on social media, if you never go outside in nature, or if you don't ever leave your house for anything other than working and going to school, you don't live healthily.

This behavior is probably a consequence of an addiction to social media or the internet. 

Let's improve that. 

### Dopamine Detoxing

The remedy for this problem is what's called “Dopamine detoxing”. If you didn't know, 

> *Dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter and hormone. It plays a role in many important body functions, including movement, memory* and **pleasurable reward and motivation**.
([Source](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine))

This means you have a dopamine addiction. In other words, you have an addiction to **pleasurable rewards**. 

#### Instant-gratification / Delayed-gratification

When doing dopamine detoxing, we will take a step back from modern technology, which is the source of **insane** quantities of dopamine for low effort. We will replace the activities that reward you instantly with the activities that give a reward to your future self. They're called **Instant-gratification** activities and **Delayed-gratification activities.**

Here are a few examples of **instant-gratification** activities:
- Fapping
- Smoking weed
- Drinking alcohol
- Playing video-games
- Scrolling on social media
- Partying

Here are a few examples of **delayed-gratification** activities:
- Reading a book
- Going for a run
- Working on a business
- Studying to get good grades
- Meditating
- Journaling

#### A practical way to start your dopamine detoxing

> Actionable Step!

Dopamine detoxing is a beautiful experience. I highly recommend you try it if you feel like it is necessary. A wonderful piece of advice I can give you is “Get back into nature”. Start exploring your city, and go to places you've never been before. 

**Choose a random flower every day and take your time to observe it from every angle possible.**

The majority of us don't find a new flower we like every day, and the majority of us are depressed. I truly believe there is a correlation between the two. It's an amazing way to start appreciating the world we live in.

> Actionable Step!

Let's start your first dopamine detox together. 
- Pick a specific number of days (anywhere from 1 to 5 is great) 
- Stop using any social media for that time. 
- Don't indulge in any instant-gratification activity. (see Instant-gratification / Delayed-gratification above).
- To replace these activities, you can take a walk or a run in nature, exercise, meditate, or read.

### Meditating

What the fuck exactly is meditating?

When you meditate, you bring your focus on one very specific thing. It can be the surrounding sounds, the feeling of breathing, the sensations in your body… While doing this, you will almost instantly start **thinking**. Without even noticing, your brain will stop focusing on your meditation, and your mind will start wondering. 

The practice of meditation is the training of noticing when your mind starts wondering, to return your focus on your meditation. 

#### A common beginner mistake

Many beginners try meditating for a few minutes. After noticing they started thinking, they **stop their meditation** out of nowhere, saying "I can't meditate. I start thinking too much!". Well! That is the **whole point** of meditating! Even the most experienced meditators start thinking. Simply go back to following your breath or whatever you're focusing on will improve your meditating skill.

#### How to start meditating

> Actionable step!

- Take your phone
- Download the app called "Medito"
- Click on "Daily Meditation"
- Follow the instructions in the 3min meditation session

Ideally, you would be building this into a habit, and you would meditate every day for the rest of your life.












**Old Page:**

I have been on Self Improvement since June 2022. According to [jamesclear.com](https://jamesclear.com/), 

> Self-improvement is **the improvement of one's knowledge, status, or character by one's own efforts**. It's the quest to make ourselves better in any and every facet of life.

It is a community of young men who want to improve themselves every day to follow their purpose. For now, I see 3 main parts of the S-I journey. Improving your [[Mental Health]]#, [[Sculpting your body]]#, and building [[Financial wealth]]#, (with all these "Financial Freedom" type of sentences). All of these require [[Discipline]]#. 

I personally believe in [[The 5 Principles of the Superior man]]#, and the fact that [[There is no definitive version of ourselves.]]#

Self improvement also resides in our natural desire to improve our [[Relationships with other people]]# and our [Social Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmbRtUNTn5M&t=2083s).

I think it is wonderful to be able to help each other. If you have any questions about Self Improvement, or simply want to join the community, you can visit [this website](https://adonis.house/), on which you can find Discord servers for each country, and potentially organize meet-ups with the people you will find there. You will find me on [the French one](https://discord.gg/csrfjguPKc).
## Stoicism
I've been recently learning about Stoicism a bit, but I still almost don't know anything. So if you have some time and would like to read what I wrote on it in order to correct me, I would be very grateful.
