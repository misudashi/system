# Self Improvement HUB
I have been on Self Improvement since June 2022. According to [jamesclear.com](https://jamesclear.com/), 

> Self-improvement isÂ **the improvement of one's knowledge, status, or character by one's own efforts**. It's the quest to make ourselves better in any and every facet of life.

It is a community of young men who want to improve themselves every day to follow their purpose. For now, I see 3 main parts of the S-I journey. Improving your [[Mental Health]]#, [[Sculpting your body]]#, and building [[Financial wealth]]#, (with all these "Financial Freedom" type of sentences). All of these require [[Discipline]]#. 

I personally believe in [[The 5 Principles of the Superior man]]#, and the fact that [[There is no definitive version of ourselves.]]#

Self improvement also resides in our natural desire to improve our [[Relationships with other people]]# and our [Social Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmbRtUNTn5M&t=2083s).

I think it is wonderful to be able to help each other. If you have any questions about Self Improvement, or simply want to join the community, you can visit [this website](https://adonis.house/), on which you can find Discord servers for each country, and potentially organize meet-ups with the people you will find there. You will find me on [the French one](https://discord.gg/csrfjguPKc).
## Stoicism
I've been recently learning about Stoicism a bit, but I still almost don't know anything. So if you have some time and would like to read what I wrote on it in order to correct me, I would be very grateful.
