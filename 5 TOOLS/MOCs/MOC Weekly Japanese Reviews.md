# Weekly Japanese Reviews (WJR)

The Weekly Japanese Reviews (WJR) will (I hope) be consistent notes in which I will be documenting the entirety of the Japanese content I consume during my immersion, as well as the lessons I'm following and some other comments on the language and the culture that goes with it.

*Also, I originally thought of that as Daily Notes. That's why you have 3 consecutive Reviews, and that's also why they're a bit messy.*

Here are all the other reviews you may be wanting to see. Some will be missing because I simply didn't consume any Japanese content during the missing time (probably holidays, they should stay rare !)
