## Japanese

Today I decided to finish learning Kana. I had already learned Hiragana using Duolingo, but it seemed a bit too long.

I  followed Tofugu's tutorial on how to learn Hiragana to be sure I did everything right, and when I felt ready, I did the same thing for Katakana.

Surprisingly enough, it went pretty well. I managed to learn the whole list and the Dakuten + Combos with it. 

This afternoon, to kind of test my abilities to remember both Hiragana and Katakana, I downloaded an app named 'Kana'. I answered about 400 questions, and I got a good 97% right.

Tomorrow I will test myself again to make sure I don't forget anything I've learned today.
