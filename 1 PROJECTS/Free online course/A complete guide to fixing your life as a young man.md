# Self Improvement Guide
- MOC: [[MOC Projects]]
- [Home](https://misudashi.ga/)

----------
This guide is made for you if you want to improve your life. I will be trying to be as clear and precise as possible. Copy and redistribute it at will. If there's an error in it, fix it. If there's something important and basic that this guide does not cover, please complain about it in an e-mail (`misudashi@yahoo.com`).

I do not recommend you skip chapters. If you are reading this, chances are I'm probably more qualified than you to decide in which order they should be and which ones you should pay attention to. Have humility and accept to learn.

### Do not trust your brain
[[Do not trust your brain]]. If you could really trust your brain, you wouldn't be sat on your computer chair reading a guide on how to fix your life. Throughout this, I will say many things that you won't agree with. Just tell your brain to shut up and continue reading. Apply what I tell you to do. If it doesn't have any result a month from now, insult me at will. Until then, you need to see me as your mentor.
