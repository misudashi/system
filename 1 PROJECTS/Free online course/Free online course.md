## Free Online Course

### Description
The goal would be to share to anyone interested very complete knowledge about a topic I have masterized. It would be a high value entirely free course, that is worth anywhere from 100 to 1000â‚¬. 

Ideally, it would be in a sector that really **needs** this type of courses because there aren't any relevant ressources available to get started in it. I would like it to become a sort of reference, something that you would always hear about everywhere when you get started in the said sector. 

### Self Improvement
I gave up a bit this idea because wasn't really hyped about the project. But I recently thought that helping other people to get started on Self Improvement could be a really great idea. So I decided to give it a try. It would be called something like [[A complete guide to fixing your life as a young man]]#
