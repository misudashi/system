### The stereotypes about meditation and why you shouldn't listen to them

So when I first started meditating, about a month ago, I was scared some people would be sceptical. They were. Of course, doesn't matter what you do that's new in your life, there will be people that will think (and say) you're wrong. Especially when you start **meditating**. 

In our modern society, when you take a step into having a better mental health, people will judge you. You shouldn't listen to them. 

You may have noticed that often, when you say "I'm starting to run every day" people that aren't really close to you won't support you. But when you are a really good runner, and you are able to do a marathon, they will be supportive. 

**People like events. Not process** The event is what you will reach if you accomplish the process. The event is having a better mental health. The process is meditating. 

Another "argument" against meditating is that it is viewed as if you were suddenly becoming a Buddhist Monk. That's not the case. You can choose that your meditation doesn't have anything to do with religions, and it will be perfectly fine. I know a lot of muslims, christians, atheists, buddhists, that meditate daily. Meditating alone did not convert them to Buddhism and it won't, especially if you are convinced you are right in your beliefs. 

You're smart enough to understand meditation doesn't act like a virus, come on.

### Why you should start meditating

There are very few downsides to meditation. The ratio pros/cons is insane. Literally 5 minutes per day. 5 minutes is all it takes to enjoy the benefits listed below.

*The benefits of meditation I, and other people from the [[a3]] community are, but are not limited to:*

- Being able to handle and manage stress better
- Increasing [self awareness]()
- Helping you focusing on the present moment 
- Concentrating better, faster, and longer
- Increasing creativity, and imagination
- Increasing patience

On my own experience, meditating was game-changing. Before starting my journey, about a month and a half ago from [now](daily-notes/15-08-2022.md), my mind was so fucked up that I couldn't purely concentrate on anything. My first ever meditating session was supposed to be 3 minutes long. I deleted the app and went on YouTube before it ended. 

I think we can say it improved my patience, since I can do 20 minutes sessions without problems to this day. (which I don't do daily). 

More importantly, and that is the first thing I'm grateful for, it helped me focusing on the present moment. I was able to concentrate better, for longer, and faster. Essentially, before starting to meditate, when I started working on something, I most of the time wasn't paying attention to what I was doing. I didn't know the concept of [Deep Work](https://timelyapp.com/blog/how-to-do-deep-work-effectively).

What you need to realize is that when you start working on something important, you should turn off your phone. Lock your door. Your eyes should never go away from your screen or your book. You should be 100% in it. 

Something really interesting happens when you meditate. Try it. Right now.  **When you finish reading THIS paragraph, close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Focus on it, feel it. Don't think of anything else than the air entering and leaving your body. *DO IT NOW* for 1 minute. Set a timer, and focus on your breathing with your eyes closed**.


Did you notice it ? Did you notice your brain ? Thoughts ? Thoughts appear. You do not control your thoughts. I bet thoughts traveled your mind. You can try again if you want. Thoughts will *appear*. Try to not have any thoughts. Trust me, that's normal. That's what we're working on when we meditate. When you're a beginner, the best way to meditate is to concentrate on your breathing. Everytime you notice you are thinking, draw your attention back on breathing. At first, sometimes, you will spend minutes thinking without noticing. But when you do, stop. When you will be trained enough, it will feel much easier to notice thoughts. And when you will be working, you won't be distracted anymore by your own thoughts.

### When should you start meditating ?

I technically cannot know your age. You could be 13, 17, 21, 31, 52, 78. To be honest, I don't really care about your age. In fact, it doesn't matter how old you are, who you are, or whatever excuse you may find, you should start meditating today. Each day, for the rest of your life, you should for the habit of meditating.

Today. Not tomorrow. Not next week-end, Not when you will be in holidays. Not next year. Not never, Now. 

### How can you start meditating ?

Okay so this one is very simple. I will give you a step-by-step guide. I *need* you to follow it. Literally, grab a paper and a pen, and note the following list. Once you're done, I want you to do what's written. Right now, go grab a sheet ! 

- Write this list down on a piece of paper.
- Take your phone
- Go in the App Store, or the Google Play Store or whatever
- Type "Medito". Download the app.
- Once you've downloaded it, it should look something like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945027080037498890/1008664808134029342/IMG_1435.png). If you can't see the screenshot, it's alright, don't worry. I'll try to fix it *asap*.
- Click "Daily Meditation". 
- "Pick a narrator & duration". Select Will (the first one), and "3 minutes". It should look something like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945027080037498890/1008665442564448266/IMG_1436.png).
- Click Begin.
- Follow the narrator's instructions.
- Once you're done with your first ever meditation session, repeat that the day after.
- Set a habit of meditating each day. 
- Once you're comfortable enough with the 3 minutes sessions (wait for at least a week without missing a single day), increase the duration to 5 minutes.
- If you start enjoying meditating, you can also follow the courses (Step 1, Step 2, etc..) the app has. You can explore the app.


#### BONUS : How to set a reliable habit of meditating each day

When I first started meditating, I would just do it whenever I had time to meditate in the day. On the toilets, on a break at work, or whatever. While you can choose to do so, I woudl'nt recommend it.

What you need to do is meditate every day, at the same time. I would recommend doing so immediately after waking up, since that's something you will always do in your day. Not a single day goes by when you don't first wake up. 

When you wake up, start the app, and meditate for 3 or 5 minutes. Close the app, and do your things. Everyday, for the rest of your life. That's what I've been doing now for a good 20 days, and so far, I can honestly say I'm doing great.
