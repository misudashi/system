## Minimalism
Minimalism advises to keep only the essential things and not to be overwhelmed by souvenirs, decorations and objects that belonged to the past.  If this first stage of sorting allows you to save space at home, it also allows you to evolve in a peaceful and positive environment.

While this can be applied to material objects, it generally also is to [[Relationships]], and to other parts of one's life.
