# Stoicism and negative thoughts
## Highlights
- From a Stoic perspective, no one can fully control when the internal manifestations of fear, stress and trauma might affect us.  But we can become more aware of them.  And we can become better able to live with and reduce their negative effects, rather than them “living through us”, and dragging us down.  Epictetus in the very opening section of his Handbook asks us to address our negative impressions as if they belonged to someone else, indeed, almost as if they were someone else:

- *Straightway, then, practice saying to every harsh appearance. You are an appearance, and in no manner what you appear to be. (Enchiridion, 1)*
