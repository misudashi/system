# Stoicism on Opinions
## Highlights
- If today we call non-precipitancy an “epistemic” virtue, it may be tempting to think of assent to impressions as belief-formation. But notably, the Stoics do not have a notion that is equivalent to today’s notion of belief. For them, every instance of “holding true” is either an opinion—in Greek, doxa—or a piece of knowledge, and it makes all the difference whether it is one or the other. Doxa is defined as weak and rash assent. The wise person does not have opinions. In other words, we should not have opinions. This norm relates to any number of themes in Stoic epistemology (cf. videos # 4, 5 and 11). For now, I mention it because non-precipitancy can also be described as a virtue of avoiding opinions.
