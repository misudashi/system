# Authenticity
## Highlights
- Think of a person whom you respect for their honesty, their frankness, their integrity.  A few names come to mind, right?  Choose one of these people and think about them for a while.  This person is real to you.  Sincere.  Authentic.  It is relaxing to meet, to get to know each other, to interact with.  We feel safe with genuine people, as if we could reveal our deepest and darkest secrets, as if we could trust them in any circumstance.  And when you get to know these people more deeply, when you establish a connection with them, it is restful to discover that they are as you think they are, that under the surface they are authentically themselves.  sincere people have no ulterior motives, but they have aspirations.  They are trustworthy, yet they don't always measure up.  They are great, but sometimes superficial.  Sincere people care enough to listen, yet sometimes they don't hear.  Sincere people are able to weather the storm, but it still gets wet.  Sincere people are passionate, contented, carefree, calm, caring and helpful.  Yet they are still people, they are human beings, so they are prone to worry and doubts, they make mistakes and make bad decisions.  Sincere people are weak.  They are imperfect.  They are fearful.  Sincere people fall prey to lust and greed, and to all the appetizers of the world.  No one is perfect, but we all have the ability to be sincere, to eliminate pretension and window dressing from our repertoire and just be who we are, not who we think we are or are meant to be.
