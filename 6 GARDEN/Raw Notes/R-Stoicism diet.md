### Highlights
 In conclusion, Stoicism is a philosophy that has been around for centuries and deserves more recognition.  Its precepts can help you achieve transcendent happiness by eating like the ancient philosophers of Stoicism.

 Thus, the purpose of our diet should be to stay alive rather than to have fun.  At least if we want to follow the wise advice of Socrates who said that many men live to eat instead of eating to live.  For the Stoics, the main reason for eating healthy is not only to improve our health, but also to strengthen our character by exercising self-awareness and the virtue of self-discipline.

### Thoughts 
I think this can be associated with instant gratification and delayed gratification. As Socrates said, A lot of people live to eat instead of eating to live. I don't think everyone should go vegan but I think we should all pay attention to what we eat because being healthy is one of the best things that you can do.
