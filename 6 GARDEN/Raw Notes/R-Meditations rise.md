# [[Meditation]]'s rise

“Developed in the 1970s by Jon Kabat-Zinn, [[Mindfulness]], relieved of its spiritual dimension, swept across the planet from 2010. Time magazine devoted its cover to it in February 2014, headlining: "The revolution  of mindfulness, the science of attention in a stressed and multitasking society".  Meditation is now everywhere: in drug treatment centers for hyperconnected young people, in the training of basketball teams or the military, in companies or in prison.  It nestles even in our smartphones via digital applications such as the American Calm and Headspace or the French Petit Bambou.”
