### Highlights
- Workplace bullying targets hence typically feel humiliated and betrayed.  They also feel robbed of a sense of agency, a powerless object.  But, as we’ve stressed, Stoicism maintains that all human beings have the inalienable capacities to think and govern their own lives.  This is non-negotiable.  No matter who your bully or bullies are, Stoicism affirms that targets have the agency to think about and respond to what is coming at them.  There is what happens to us, then there is what we do with it.
- What all this means is that, no matter how much a job threatened by bullying might mean to a person, a Stoic approach suggests that there is more to them than this one role.  So, no matter what the bullying threatens and can in fact in some cases actually take away, targets will always have other parts of their life that they can foster and cultivate, as they look beyond their current situation, and towards a life after the bullying has ended, in this workplace or another.
