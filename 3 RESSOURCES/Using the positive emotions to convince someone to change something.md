## Using the positive emotions to convince someone to change something
While it can sometimes be a good idea to use the negative emotions to convince someone to do something, it can have some devastating effects.

For instance, if a company is about to go bankrupt, it may be a good idea to use the negative emotions on the CEO to convince him to take a decision that goes in your way. In this case, making him visualising his cherished company falling, his employees being jobless, him losing money, can have a real emotional impact, and can trigger a situation where he seeks help, which you will bring to him.

As you understand, you most likely will not succeed if you use this method in your day-to-day life. If your best friend is getting married, and you see that his socks aren't the same, I do not recommend to make him visualize his marriage burning, his future wife divorcing him, and him dying in a car crash, as this may ruin your friendship (and the-said marriage).

Alternatively, conveying positive emotions can be a good and simple solution to your current problem. Instead of telling your friend his marriage is going to be a total mistake if he doesn't change socks, you should make him visualize how beautiful and how much better it would be, if he had the same socks. Not only will he be more likely to listen to you, but he will go change his socks with a smile on his face, hoping for the best, instead of going completely panicked, not knowing if he's going to survive this event. He will view you as a hero, because you made his marriage even better.

## Ecology

I think this can be applied in lots of different domains in life, but one especially is Ecology. While I think that the activists have good intentions, they often aren't smart with what they say. I think that instead of giving the illusion of a burning world 2 years from now if we don't do anything, they should bring hope to as much people as possible. They should tell the people how much better the world would be if we all were creative and if we found solutions about the given problems. 

This will activate creativity, and it will allow us to actually make progress on climate change. Instead of having panicked, and useless people everywhere, there will be people willing to help about this cause, with the hope that they will live in a green paradise if they do.

## Thoughts

I think this is a really interesting way of convincing people. It is also pretty enjoyable, because you give hope and dreams to people, while solving their problems. The only issue I have with this is that if you give too much hope to someone, they may be sad finding that things are not as they expected.
For instance, when your friend realizes no one even noticed that he changed socks, he may end up disappointed. You have to set realistic hopes to people in order to have them satisfied at the end of the day.
