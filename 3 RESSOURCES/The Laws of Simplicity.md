----------
There are 10 laws and 3 keys to simplicity for John Maeda.

**The 10 Laws:**

- 1) Reducing. To reach simplicity, the best thing is reducing methodically.

- 2) *Organizing*. With organization, a whole made out of multiple elements seems simpler.

- 3) *Time*. By saving time, we feel like everything is simpler.

- 4) *Knowledge*. Knowledge simplifies everything.

- 5) *Differences*. Simplicity and Complexity need each other.

- 6) *Context*. What's on the edge of simplicity isn't on the edge.

- 7) *Emotion*. More emotion's better than less.

- 8) *Confidence*. Is simplicity, we are confident.

- 9) *Failure*. Some things can't be simplified.

- 10) *Cardinal Law*. Simplicity consists in removing what's obvious and adding what makes sense.

**The 3 Keys**:

- 1) *Far away*. Biggers seems smaller, if we're far from it.
- 2) *Open*. Complexity open is simplicity.
- 3) *Power*. Using less, moving more.

### Thoughts

I didn't understand anything he said, except when it was so simple a 5 years old could have understanded it. I didn't like this book at all. 1.5/10. He also always takes the same examples, which makes the whole book super boring. (Such as Apple). This book isn't a complete waste of time, but I don't recommend reading it.
