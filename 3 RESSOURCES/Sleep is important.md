## Sleep is important

Everyone will tell you to get from 6 to 8 hours of sleep. They're wrong. If you are working out, you **need** more rest than the others. Get MORE than 8 hours. Anywhere between 8 and 10 hours per night is fine.

There's no such thing as overtraining, it's **under-recovering**.

If you have to wake up at 6, then it's fine, you won't have 9 hours of sleep. But when you come back from work, there's nothing stopping you from taking a 30min-1h nap.
