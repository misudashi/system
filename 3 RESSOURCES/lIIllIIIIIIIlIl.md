> Habit stacking is a special form of an [[llIIIIIIllIIllI|Implementation Intention]]. Rather than pairing your new [[lIllllllIIlIlIl|Habits]] with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious [[lIlIlIIlIlIlIII|Cue]] for nearly any habit.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

The habit stacking formula is:

“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

Habit stacking is a positive version of [[lllIllIIIIIlIll|The Diderot Effect]].

Your evening routine make look something like this:
1. After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the
dishwasher.
2. After I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the
counter.
3. After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for
tomorrow morning.
