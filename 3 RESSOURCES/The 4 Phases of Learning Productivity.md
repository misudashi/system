---------- 
- **Phase 1**: You are unconsciously incompetent.  
- **Phase 2**: You are consciously incompetent.  
- **Phase 3**: you are consciously competent.
- **Phase 4**: you are unconsciously competent.

#### Phase 1 : You are unconsciously incompetent

There can be **two ways** you are unconsciously incompetent.

- You don't know anything about productivity, and you simply do what you feel like doing without realizing it makes you unproductive.
- You already know a lot about productivity, but you try to apply everything at the same time, and it makes you unproductive unconsciously. You may even be spending more time *Planning and Organizing* instead of actually *Working*.

#### Phase 2: You are consciously incompetent

You just realized that you actually **are** incompetent in productivity, and you want to change that. The first question you need to ask yourself is "What makes me unproductive and how can I fix it ?"

#### Phase 3: You are consciously competent

After realizing that you were incompetent, you decided to work on it and now you finally know that you are competent. You apply productivity methods, but you don't *abuse* them, with the goal of working better.

#### Phase 4: You are unconsciously competent

In this phase, being productive is just natural to you because you have done it so much. The example Everlaab uses in this article is driving : at first, you were paying attention to everything you were doing. But after a few years of driving, it seems really natural to you and you don't even think about it anymore.
