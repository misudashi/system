----------
Asking "What was your added value today ?" can be a great way to know if one is in the right path or not in a company. 

You can also think "What is the added value of this action ?"

This question will help you deciding whether or not you should do something : 

"Mh.. I don't really know what to do. I guess I'll watch some Netflix. Wait.. What's the added value of watching this ? Okay, alright, then I will go read a book instead."
