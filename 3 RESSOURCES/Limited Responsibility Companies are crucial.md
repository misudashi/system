This type of company allows creativity. Jordan Peterson explains here that most entrepreneurial ideas are fundamentally destructive, counterproductive, and dangerous. But some of them are good, and that's the whole problem of innovation. He says that we can't distinguish them, so we just have to try them.

And how to do that? Letting all the entrepreneurs fail one by one using Limited Responsibility Companies, instead of "normal" companies. When an entrepreneur fails while using one of these companies, it's the ideas that die rather than them. Therefore, it doesn't scare people as much. If these companies didn't exist, no one would take such a risk, of being in debt for the rest of their lives.

On a societal side, this flow of constant new ideas being tried is crucial to continue innovation.
