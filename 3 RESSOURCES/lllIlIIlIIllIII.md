"Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all. When people suggest you follow your “passion” or your “bliss,” I propose that they are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement. This brings us full circle. The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are my goals?” but “What would excite me?”"

I would like to add that your goals should be aligned with your [[lllllIlIIllIIII]]#, which is one of the central topics of [[self-improvement]]. Keep in mind you'll need to [[llIIlllIIllIllI]].
