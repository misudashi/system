The flow (or optimal experience): our brain is entirely focusing on what we're doing, resulting in the absence of distractions, as well as the notion of time. Hobbys and tasks that require a lot of mental effort are generally good flow generators.

### Personal note
I heard people that go to the gym say "the zone" to refer to this state of flow. I wonder if they're exactly the same.
