If you are new to the gym, you should take a look at a few concepts such as [[IlIlIIlIIlIIllI]]#, [[llIlIllllIIllll]]#, [[lllIlIIIIlllIII]]#. 

If you aren't going to the gym yet and you're wondering if [[IIIIIIllllIIllI]]# is enough to build an **attractive body**, it is not. Please watch this [No Bullshit Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uILhdYr_UDs) on building one.

To go further into the details, you will have to understand that [[lIlIlllIIIIIIII]]#. If you are already a few months into your journey, you may be wondering "[[IIllIIllIIllIII]]# ?".
