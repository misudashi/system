Download [this zip file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/vyb90e8x3d0wia1/yoitv.zip/file) and extract it. Run the .exe file, and follow the installer instructions. Run the App you just downloaded (which is called YoiTV), go to the sign up page and use `141908613` as the ID. Enter a random password (I recommend using 1234 or something, so you don't accidentally give out any information!)

I found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/JTV/comments/oehs3c/comment/h5i9aum/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on reddit, which explains well the problem with YoiTV: 

> All Japanese IPTV providers are Chinese. They all sell pirated content practically for free compared to official prices.
> 
> Like all pirated IPTV providers they have constant pressure and law suits from the rights owners to stop operating. That's why NHK or fuji sometimes disappears, that's why their websites sometimes disappear or they have to change name or location. They only survive because they operate out of China where it's easier to evade law suits.
>
> None of them are more a scam than the other and all of them can get into problems at any time.
How can any of those "services" be official or dependable when they give away 80 channels for no money at all? The official JPTV option in my country costs 80 a month and that is for just 1 channel with has a selection of programming from different Japanese channels.
>
>Yes their marketing seems fishy but its just Chinese way of doing business and bad English.
If you are not prepared to loose money when they possibly stop working you should not buy pirated content.
>
>The yoiTV thing is free for a month, just try it and afterwards you can spend 200 a year on any of the available brands and then pray it will keep working.

I want to add that to my knowledge, it doesn't contain any virus. But just in case, it's always good to have some kind of anti-virus. I wouldn't recommend paying anything to these types of companies. Just enjoy your 30d trial and find another way to watch JP TV. Maybe using different Key Codes? In case it works, here are some more I found on [their website](https://livejapanesetv.wordpress.com/yoitv-free-key-codes/).

Finally, on their website they say "Anyone can contact them to continue to get a free extension when YoiTV’s one-month trial period ends. [Learn More>>](https://livejapanesetv.wordpress.com/2021/08/04/free-japanese-tv-app-yoitv-will-be-over-how-to-renew/)". If I was you, I would never even e-mail them because it's 100% certain that your e-mail will be spammed or something by many companies that bought their data.
