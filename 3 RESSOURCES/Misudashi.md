# Misudashi
- MOC: [[MOC Notes]]
- [Home](https://misudashi.ga/)
---------- 
This website is a hobby of mine, in which I have decided to share my knowledge with everyone, for free, and forever.

As of right now, I enjoy learning all kinds of things. 
- I enjoy studying languages (currently [[MOC Japanese]])
- More generally, I enjoy learning new things, from neuro-sciences, to maths, to poetry, and more widely art in general, including architecture.
- I have been on [[MOC Self Improvement]] since June 2022. 

##  Contact
I don't have any social media but you can send me an e-mail, to which I will be answering as fast as possible, generally in one or two business days.

Alternatively, you can contact me *via* Discord : `Misudashi#4584`, even if I tend to reply less often there.
