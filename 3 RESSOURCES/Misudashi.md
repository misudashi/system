- MOC: [[MOC Notes]]
- [Home](https://misudashi.ga/)
---------- 
My name is Erwan Sillon. I have been on [[MOC Self Improvement]] since July 2022.

**I am French and patriotic. I believe in working hard and getting my tasks done.**

This website is a hobby of mine, in which I have decided to share my knowledge with everyone, for free, and forever. I also wanted to create it so people can look at what I was working on, reading, and thinking, before I was successful.

I don't have a lot of free time, but when I do, I tend to do the following activities:
- Learn languages (currently [[MOC Japanese]])
- Learn Neuro-sciences (see [[MOC The Human Brain]]) & Sciences in general (mostly Maths and Physics)
- Read & Write Poetry, although I enjoy Art as a whole
- Read books. Currently [[How To Win Friends and Influence People]] - Dale Carnegie

##  Contact
I don't have any social media but you can send me an e-mail, to which I will be answering as fast as possible, generally in one or two business days.

Alternatively, you can contact me *via* Discord : `Misudashi#4584`, even if I tend to reply less often there.
