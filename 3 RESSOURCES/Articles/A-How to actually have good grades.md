## How to actually have good grades
How many times did you exit your class, thinking you understood everything, when in reality you catched only 10% of what was said ? How many times were you in front of your test, with a literally blank mind ? Did you ever wonder why you simply couldn't get good grades, doesn't matter how hard you worked ? Well I did. 

### The 3 Simple steps to study properly

In this article, I will be giving away a bit of my knowledge about grades and about memory. Let's get right into it.

**Summary**

	- The truth about taking notes
		- Understanding the subject
			- How does your memory improve when you teach ?
		- Keeping a way of remembering what you just understood : taking notes

#### How to actually take notes
You were probably taught that in class, you were supposed to take notes. And that's true ! Wait.. That's true, right ?

Indeed, it is. But there's a twist.

##### The truth about taking notes
The process of taking notes seems so boring. Simply writing a bunch of unconprehensible lines, knowing that it's going to be a pain when you want to read that again. For the best students, some fancier notes with highlights, that end up being prettier than the grade you get using it. 

So how are you actually supposed to take notes ? 

Well to answer this simple question, we firstly need to define what you need to do in order to have a good grade. 

Generally, it comes in two factors :
- How much one **understands** about the subject.
- How much one is capable of **remembering** of the subject.

###### Understanding the subject
So you firstly need to understand what's happening. But how can you measure that exactly ? Well. The most effective way of testing, and improving your ability of understanding something is **teaching**. 

"But how can I teach something that I don't know, Misudashi ? You're dumb, you didn't think of tha-"

Shut up. What you need to do is to simply reformulate what you just understood.

**How does your memory improve when you teach ?**
Teaching, essentially, is reformulating something. Right now, I am technically teaching you something, and I am simply reformulating a concept I understood. This activity affects your brain because your will create more links between your neurons, so it easier when you want to come back and find that information again. At the end of each class, you should try to teach to a friend of yours, or alternatively reformulate with *your own words* everything you can remember. 

For instance, at the end of this article, you would be needed to think, say, or write : "Okay, so there were 3 main steps to get good grades : The first one is to take good notes with this method, and the Second one is to do that, etc". 

###### Keeping a way of remembering what you just understood : taking notes
And that's where it all makes sense. You're capable of reformulating what you understood, right ? Well that's exactly what the process of taking notes is all about. After reformulating all of this in your head, you will want to draw a mind map. It doesn't have to be fancy at all, don't worry. It would literally take 5 minutes. Like seriously, **don't make it fancy**. Here's how mine looks:

#### How to use your notes
You will all agree with me, learning on the mindmap above is not ideal. But does it have to be ? No. It doesn't, because you won't actually learn anything on this mindmap. 

Once you get back home, you have two choices :
- Transform this *ugly* mindmap into a beautiful electronic one.
- Work with this mindmap, because you won't use them up anyway.

I recommend trying out both, because it all comes to your preferences. By choosing the first one, on the one hand, you will lose time. On the other hand, it will **feel** more professional. (It won't **be** more professional, as professionals aren't those who have beautiful mindmaps, but those who can remember things.). Anyway, the choice really is up to you !

##### (Optionnal) How to transform your mindmap

I recommend using the logicial [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the plugin called "Mindmap". 

Here is mine, made in just under 2 minutes:

###### How to use your mindmap
We will be using [[A-The Ebbinghaus Curve]] to remember efficiently this mindmap. At first, you will need to practice re-doing it on paper or in your mind immediately after creating it. Then, a day after. And following what I said in the above article, you will be able to retrace it super easily. It shouldn't take you very long every day, and you can do that for every subject you want to study. **That's** your homework.

#### The day of the exam
The second you receive the test, without even looking at the questions, take a sheet of paper and retrace the mindmap you spent "so much time" remembering. 

Then, use it to answer to the questions. Simple, practical, efficient, and many other adjectives.
