# Newton's First Law

[[Newton]]'s First Law, or the Principle of Inertia, states that any object will retain its state of rest or uniform straight line motion in which it finds itself, unless a force is applied to that body.


## Utility
We can use this law as an argument to sell a product or a course. Once you have done the small effort of taking and applying my course, your knowledge will continue in the direction you set forever, without any effort. 

We can also say that if they do not follow our course, their knowledge will retain its state of rest forever.

Alternatively, we could say that they were in this state of rest because they didn't follow my course until now, but now that "a force is applied to that body" (in our case, the body being their knowledge), they will finally start moving forward and apply what I said in the first paragraph of this section.

## Note
I must say that Newton's First Law applies in infinite void, to keep credibility. 

I don't have to get their attention on it, but simply mention it. As a matter of fact, if I do not mention it, the law wouldn't work and people would eventually notice that detail, and roast me for this.
