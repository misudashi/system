# Socrates' 3 Filters for Information
**Source** : [Les 3 Filtres de Socrate]([](https://www.penser-et-agir.fr/les-3-filtres-de-socrate/))

## The Story
As you probably know, Socrates didn't write anything so the follow text may not be what was really said, word by word.

The disciple comes to see Socrates to tell him what he heard from a friend of Socrates.

 In front of Socrates, the disciple seems rather worried and troubled.  This does not go unnoticed by Socrates who lets him speak.  The disciple: “Master, I have something to tell you.  Your friend said bad things about you.  “.

 *Reminder: These are not the exact words.  It's just an interpretation.*

 Socrates: “Ah!  But before I continue, I'm going to run your message through three filters.  » The 3 filters of Socrates.

 The disciple: “Yes, I am listening”.

 Socrates: “First filter: Are you sure what you have to tell me is true?  “.

 The disciple: "I'm not sure it's real master, but..."

 Socrates: “You are not sure if it is true, are you at least convinced that what you have to say to me is good?  “.

 Disciple: “That is not a good master.  “.

 Socrates: “So what you have to say to me is not good and is not even sure to be true, is it?  Last filter, is what you have to tell me useful for me, for him or for both of us?’.

 Disciple: “Not really no”.

**And as you guessed, Socrates then did not want to hear what his friend said about him.**

## Interpretation
So why did Socrates filter this information, afterall ? 

I think these filters are really relevant, especially when it comes to our modern society, where informations literally fly around us, resulting in our brains absorbing thousands every hour. 

When you think about it, these filters really make a lot of sense. But let us view them a bit further.

### First Filter : The truth
Is the information I'm about to consume, or maybe I already have, at least is the truth ? 

Absorbing a false information can be really devastating in lots of ways. It could ruin friendships, lead to wars, and even more !

Making sure the informations you get are right is much more important than a lot of people think.

### Second Filter : Is this information good for me ?

Okay. So apparently, you aren't sure that the information is true. But will it at least be good for you ? 

Say an information just dropped : a random person you never heard of just died. Will it be a good thing for you to know that ? Will it make you happier ? No ? So why listen to it ? The information goes through this filter as well, it's time to use the last one.

### Third Filter : Utility
Okay. So you aren't sure that the information you're about to consume is true, and it isn't good for you either. At the *very least*, is it useful ?

A message is useful to you when it adds something to your personal improvement. It may get you closer to your goals as well. 

Does the information tick one of these two conditions ?

If it doesn't, then you probably shouldn't listen to this information.

### Thoughts
I think that this is an interesting way to deal with the *amount* of information we are used to consume every day. Though, you may not often have the time to apply these filters in your every day life, and sometimes you simply hear things you didn't even want to. 


While I think this is alright, there isn't really anything revolutionary. Maybe the future will give me wrong. 

An interesting way of using these, though, is about dealing with the information you already have consumed. About choosing if a given information will actually affect you or not (when you are able to controle your feelings, obviously.). I need to experiment a bit with that. I may come back to this article if I think of anything more to say about it.
