*Translation :*

1. **Look**
2. **Add in your reading List**
3. **Read**
4. **Take Notes**

In this article, we will be reviewing how to properly do each of these steps so you effectively acquire knowledge on the long-term.

## 1. Look
In this part, you will be seeking for interesting content that :
- You would enjoy consuming
- Will bring you knowledge

It can be (and it should be) composed of articles, books, podcasts, videos, and so on.

### How to find good articles
We will be using an app called Feedly. If you don't know it yet, first of all, you can download it by typing 'Feedly' in the App Store, or Google Play Store.

Once you've downloaded it, my best advice would be to get familiar with it. Its purpose is for you to "subscribe" to news websites that you, specifically you, enjoy. There are many categories you can choose from if you press the [+] bottom icon. 


## 2. Add in your reading List
Once you've found an interesting website, simply add it to your collection. On the home page will be displayed every article they post. Once you've found an interesting article, click on it, then press the [Share] button. *Once you have finished this tutorial, Raindrop.io should be there, and you will simply have to click on the icon and continue browsing articles for the sake of finding interesting ones.*
## 3. Read
Reading web articles can sometimes be difficult, due to all the pop-ups, the "pLeAsE aCcEpT cOoKiEs", the ads, etcetera. 

To overcome this difficulty, we will be using an app called Raindrop.io. It will allow you to have a clear, clean, ad-free interface on which you can read any article you desire to. 

First, download it using the App Store, or the Google Play Store.

Once you have done that, you're pretty much done. Again, my personal advice would be to try every function of the app to try and get familiar with it. If you don't have time to, it's alright, don't worry. 

Next time you want to read an article, share it, and select "Raindrop.io". The open it *via* the home page.

A cool feature you can use is the Highlighting. Simply select the text and use a color. You can also copy the text for the next step : *Taking Notes*.

## 4. Take Notes
In this part, you will learn how to *properly take notes*.

The app I recommend is obviously **Obsidian**. In my opinion, it is the best due to its Graphic View, its interface, and its portability.

A thing you have to understand is that any article, YouTube video, or book, is simply made out of *bricks*. And these bricks are called *Concepts*. For example, while reading this, you can pretty much break it into different concepts: The Best way to read articles, How to find interesting articles, etcetera. 

Simply open a new note in Obsidian, call it by the name of the Concept (usually the chapter's title, but this can change : it's up to you. You may also encounter multiple concepts in a single chapter.)

Then, write a little summary using **your own words** of the concept of the note. 

Finally, the next step is to [link]() your notes with existing ones in your system. For example, I may link this Article with [[Productivity]].

### The advantage of Obsidian
After a few hundred notes, you can check the Graph View of Obsidian and observe how each note are linked to each other, creating your very own **2nd Brain**. This can help you in lots of ways, which I won't go into details in this article because it isn't the subject !
