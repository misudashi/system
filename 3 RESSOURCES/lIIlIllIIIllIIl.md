----------
Hermann Ebbinghaus was a 19th century German philosopher.  Considered the father of the experimental psychology of learning, he is at the origin of the Ebbinghaus Curve.

**The Ebbinghaus Curve** is a method based on a theory with the same name, made to **improve the "amount" of information** ("*RÃ©tention d'information*" on the graph) we will **keep in mind after learning a given information** (such as vocabulary, a book, a formula, ...), influenced by **the time passing** ("*10 min, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months*" on the graph).

It is based on [[IlIIIIIIIlIllII]], and on the fact that the more an information is repeated in our brain, the better we will learn it.

**The usual method** consists in remembering the information after 10 minutes, then after a day, a week, a month, and finally 6 months (180 days) after the first time we encountered the-said information.

*I would like to add that in order to be learned, an information needs to be understood. The reminders you have set to remember it should be at first close together, and they should get further and further in time as it goes on.*

**My personal theory is that *simply reading again* the information is *NOT ENOUGH*. You should use programs such as Anki to create flash cards.**
