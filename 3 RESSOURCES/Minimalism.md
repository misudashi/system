# Minimalism

"Minimalism advises to keep only the essential things and not to be overwhelmed by souvenirs, decorations and objects that belonged to the past.  If this first stage of sorting allows you to save space at home, it also allows you to evolve in a peaceful and positive environment.

While this can be applied to material objects, it generally also is to [[Relationships]], and to other parts of one's life."

### Opinion

I have to say I'm pretty *attracted* to the concept of minimalism. As of right now, I only tried to reduce adding things that "aren't useful" in my everyday-life. Thus, I buy less useless things, but I still have a lot of things that I didn't give away or sell. That's actually something I really want to do, but it can sometimes be weird for others. 

For instance, if a friend of mine gave me some random decoration object last christmas, how would he react if I just sold it or if I gave it away to charity ? It's actually a pretty tough question, and while I'm sure people will understand the concept, most of them will subconsciously think "damn was my gift that bad ?".
