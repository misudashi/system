> There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

-Outcome is your goal. *Being as mindful as possible.*

-Process is how you do it. *Meditating each day.*

-Identity is who you are. *I am the type of guy who takes mindfulness and attention span to the next level.* See [[lllIlIlIlIlllll|Changing identity]].
