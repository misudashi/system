## The Zeigarnik Effect

-   The Zeigarnick effect (named after Bluma Zeigarnik) takes place when we interrupt an activity. We tend to be able to recall it better. This implies that we remember better the unfinished tasks, rather than the ones that we consider finished.

-   The Zeigarnick effect shouldn't be confused with [[The Ovsiankina effect]].
