"Attention is not an infinite resource. It cannot multiply, only divide. The brain can carry out several tasks at the same time, but always at the expense of the attention given to each one."

As a drummer, I have experienced this through some exercises. For instance, this morning, I had a lesson in which I was supposed to sing a rythm, while playing a completely different one. I succeeded when I was playing a simple rythm, but as soon as it became a bit difficult, I felt that my attention was divided between the two things I had to concentrate on.
