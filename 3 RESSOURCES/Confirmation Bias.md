----------
-   Confirmation bias is the tendency humans have to interpret, prefer, and search for information that confirms one's initial opinion about a specific topic. This means that we tend to **select** the information that supports our beliefs, and neglect or completely ignore contrary information.Â 

-   This effect is even stronger when we have an emotional link with and in some cases a deep connection with the belief, for example, if we are convinced something is true.
