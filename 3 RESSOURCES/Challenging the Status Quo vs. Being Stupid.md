## Challenging the Status Quo vs. Being Stupid

> Most people walk down the street on their legs.
Does that mean I walk down the street on my hands?
Do I wear my underwear outside of my pants in the
name of being different? Not usually, no. Then again,
walking on my legs and keeping my thong on the
inside have worked just fine thus far. I don’t fix it if it
isn’t broken.
**Different is better when it is more effective or more
fun.**
