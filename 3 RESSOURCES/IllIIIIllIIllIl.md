Whenever you buy something, you should always take into consideration the potential consequences, and not only the immediate ones. For example, if you are planning on buying a new TV, you should think of:
- **Its price**, the obvious consequence
- **The time you will spend watching TV**, the less obvious one
- **The consequences on the longer run**, the transparent ones: the electricity cost for instance.

If you buy a brand new supercar, you should think of its price, of course. But also the guilt you will feel if you don't drive it enough => you will spend more time driving to avoid the guild => you will waste time. You should also think of the value it loses every time you use it, because there's a kilometer counter: most of the time, we only think of the immediate consequences whenever we buy stuff.
