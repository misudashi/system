> If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues.  The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that youâ€™ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the [[lIlIlIIlIlIlIII|Cue]] for good habits is right in front of you.

> Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how
> we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people
> live in a world others have created for them.

> Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

We should make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
