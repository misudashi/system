Your mental health is the central point of the [[MOC Self Improvement]] journey. Firstly, I recommend you take [this Mood self-assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/depression-anxiety-self-assessment-quiz/) test, to be able to compare your results in a few months. You can watch [this no BS guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E6cg8c0M38) on mental health, made by one of the most popular S-I YouTubers out there.

To put it in a nutshell,in order to improve your mental health, you can start Meditating (See [[The Benefits Of Meditation]]#) and Journaling. This will help you to improve your [[Relationships with other people]]#.

A lifestyle I **personally** see as beneficial is [[Minimalism]]#. You may want to look into [[Discipline]] as well.
