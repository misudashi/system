- [Home](https://misudashi.ga/)
---------- 
### 1. Discipline 
- The most important virtue of all, without this virtue all self improvement is meaningless “Do the hard work especially when you don’t feel like it” 
- This quote is to be taken quite Literally if you don’t feel like doing something then there is actually more reason to do it. This will create an unbelievable amount of discipline. 
- For example if you wake up feeling horrible, then there is more reason to get out of bed to build the skill of discipline 
- Discipline helps builds mental and physical strength which is crucial to our winner energy 
- The Gym is a crucial area to build masculine energy and mental strength 

### 2. Humility 
- Humility is having a student mindset, it’s realising that you don’t know that much. 
- Consider the entire world, there is probably around 5 billion people who are over the age of 18. Every single one of those people will be more knowledgeable in a certain field/aspect compared to you. Therefore, we must have humility and respect for everyone’s opinions and realise that we can learn from anyone. 
- Do not be blinded by your progress, we should always be striving for more. 
- We need to be able to admit our areas of weakness and we also must be able to ask for help when we don’t understand something. 
- Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know.” 

### 3. Presence 
“Your ability to bring back a wandering mind.” 
- Built by meditation 
- Meditate every single day at the same time for the rest of your life 
- Presence/mindfulness can improve 100% of the rest of your life 
- Significantly improves relationships 
- Presence is the ability to speak to your loved ones without your mind wandering and thinking about bullshit 
- Ability to stay focused and enter a flow state 

### 4. Gratitude 
- Looking at something in a positive view 
- We should even be grateful for the negative things that have happened to us. As they have helped to shape who we are today. 
- Suffering often cause growth 
- The happiest people are often the most grateful 
- You have to be grateful with your current position in life, as only then will you continue to progress 

### 5. Leadership
- Once you have cultivated the 4 other qualities, it is now time to teach this to other people. 
- To further you own growth and that of your community you must begin to teach more men these virtues. 
- it’s a lonely life if we take this path alone. We must bring others along to also take part in this journey 
- Strong men will be rewarded
