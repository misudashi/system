Motivational Rituals consist in doing something you enjoy immediately before doing something hard. 

For example, instead of telling yourself you need to go to run, you can tell yourself you get to go to run, and thus, increase your cardio and your speed.

You will then feel [[llllllllIIIIIIl|Craving]] to do your good habit.
