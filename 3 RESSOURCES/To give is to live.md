## To give is to live
If you do not give of yourself to contribute to the lives of others, you will forever lead a life of selfishness. 

It is normal to act in one's own interest, but to do only that leads to a fruitless existence. A life devoid of any contribution to the life of others is a life devoid of meaning. In reality, to give is to live. 

We only feel truly alive through personal development and contribution to the lives of others. This is real life. That's living life to the full. It is a healthy life, rich in quality relationships and full of passion
