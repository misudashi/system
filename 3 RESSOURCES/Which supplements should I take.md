You don't **need** supplements. It's just a nice little bonus to have.

- **Creatine** => 10€ for 6 months
- **Protein Powder** => 30/50€ for 6 months
- **Vitamine** **D** => 2€ for a pack of like 1000
- **Zinc** => 4€ for a pack of like 100

BUY THESE CHEAP. They should be a couple of € each. Literally buy these on eBay for 99c. Don't buy the "delivered to your door" "made for men" shit, they're the exact same thing.
