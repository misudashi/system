> Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing: you want to take action.

- Brainstorming ideas for articles you want to write is being in Motion
- Writing an article is taking Action

Sometimes Motion can be good, however more often than not, you're [[IlIlIIIIIlIlIII|Procrastinating by doing something productive]]. Stop learning about fitness and diet, the best workout possible, etc, if you don't even go to the gym yet. Set up a habit of exercising every day, then you can wonder if what you're doing is effective or not.

We tend to prefer Motion because it is a way to delay failure: you feel like you're working towards your goal, but without the risk of failing, whereas it is likely that you will fail many times when you take action. Also see [[lllIIllllIllllI|Failure]].
