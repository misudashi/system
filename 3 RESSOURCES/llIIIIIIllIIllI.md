> People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

The best way to implement an intention is to fill out the following sentence:

I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

- Meditation: I will meditate for 5 minutes at 7:00 am after waking up in my bedroom.
