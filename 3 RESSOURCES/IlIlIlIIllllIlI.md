> Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

- Systems are better than Goals on the long-term for 4 reasons:

-Winners and losers have the same goals. *What changes between a good and a worse professional boxers isn't their goal: they both want to win. It's their system: how they train, what they eat, how they sleep, ...*

-Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. *Imagine you have the goal "Clean my room", and you end up succeeding. If you have the same bad system of throwing garbage on the floor, you will still end up with a dirty room 2 days from now. If you have a good system, you will have a clean room for the rest of your life.*

-Goals restrict your happiness. *"Once I have ... I can be happy." makes you always wait until you reach your next milestone before being happy. Enjoying the process makes you much happier, while reaching your goals more easily.*

-Goals are at odds with long-term progress. *Once you have reached your goal, you probably won't have motivation to continue. That's why many successful athletes end up quitting. If you enjoy the process, you will never have to have motivation to continue: even after reaching your goal, you will continue making progress.*
