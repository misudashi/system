## Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten is a knowledge-managing and a note-taking method. This method is more effective with computer resources, and in particular, with the help of knowledge management software. That said, this method can also be used through index cards.

In addition to facilitating the classification of ideas, this method also aims to improve creativity. Cross-referencing through markers allows users to perceive connections and relationships between individual units of information that might not appear obvious in an isolated context. These emerging aspects of the method thus maintain a certain similarity with the neural networks with which we can converse.

This is how my Zettel Graph looks right now :
