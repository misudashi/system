## Dopamine Detox
A dopamine detox is when you stop indulging in activities that give you **dopamine** (aka "pleasure") for a specific number of days. I personally feel like there are multiple "levels" of dopamine detoxing, which I will be trying to explain below:

### Beginner dopamine detox
In a beginner dopamine detox, we want you to take back control over your [[Attention]], that was stolen by modern technologies. You will stop indulging in activities such as social media, video-games, porn, and drugs for a few days in order to free your mind from the bad effects of the excessive amount of dopamine they give you.

### Full dopamine detox
In a full dopamine detox, we want you to **actually** stop doing as many activites that give you **any** dopamine for a few days. This includes, but is not limited to social media, video-games (and any kind of modern technology), porn, drugs, but also talking to people, eating anything that gives you pleasure, reading, going out, partying. Essentially, anything that makes you happy. You should not do that for too long! It's mainly used to find your [[Purpose]] in the Self-Improvement community.

### Long-run dopamine detox
In this kind of dopamine detox, we want you to set realistic rules. After setting them, I personally recommend you to ask yourself "could I live like this for a full year?". If that's the case, then your rules probably aren't too difficult. You shouldn't stop a long-run dopamine detox after a few days, as opposed to the previous levels described. It is made to last for your entire life: it allows you to stay productive ([[Productivity]]) and to exactly control your dopamine. Generally, we will replace instant-gratification activities by delayed-gratification ones. (See [[Instant-Gratification and Delayed-Gratification]]#)
