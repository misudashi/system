I clicked on this video because I thought it could help me learn something new. I was wrong because I had already read about every single habit he mentioned in this video. I have already applied two of them, which are journaling and meditating, and I know that when I will be launching my business, I will need to seek the possibility of [[Leverage]] and, of course, choose the right vehicle. I guess I lost my time. Anyway, here's a small recap of the habits he used:

- He turned his phone on airplane mode every time he started working
He explains here that the one thing that 99% of the population lacks isn't knowledge or energy, but instead Focus. He also says that if you have focus, you can acquire that energy and that knowledge, through deep work. 

-   He started journaling and meditating
The second habit he mentions in this video is journaling, and he also recommends meditating. He says that self-awareness works like a muscle you train to understand yourself better.

-   He chose the right vehicle
I don't get how this can be a habit, but he says that it doesn't matter how hard you work, it is likely that you won't ever see a million dollars if you don't choose the right vehicle. He says that to make money, your business should allow you to either : 
	- Be very well paid for your time
	- Use [[Leverage]]
