> The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, youâ€™ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

- This also applies for bad habits: if you get 1% worse every day, you will be near 0 after one year.
