> With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

He took the example of a guy who worked in a jail for a few years. After quitting his job, he would sometimes randomly yell "Walk!" to children he saw running.

For behavior changing (see [[lllIIlIlllllIlI|The 4 Laws of Behavior Change]]), he said:

> The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

He suggests we say out loud "I am about to eat a cookie to satisfy my craving. It is detrimental to my health and to my goals." before eating a cookie if we want to stop eating junk food.

Japanese train employees use the "Pointing-and-Calling" method to increase the awareness of their actions. This way, they avoid mindlessly using their habits, and they make less errors.

Finally, to increase the awareness of your behaviors, you can use what he calls the "Habits Scorecard": you simply have to list every thing you do after you wake up for example, and then label them: is it detrimental to your future self, is it good, or is it neutral?
