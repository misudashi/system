---------- 
You should watch a few videos on:
- Calorie
	- Calorie maintenance / surplus / deficit
- Macronutrients
	- Protein / Fats / Carbs
- The most effective way would be to track every single gram of food you're eating. But you and I know it's **a lot** of effort, so I would recommend simly avoiding overeating.
