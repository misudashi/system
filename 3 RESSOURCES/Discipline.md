----------
Discipline is the skill of doing **what you should do** (aka **working hard**), even when you **don't** feel like it. You can take inspiration from some people such as [David Goggins](https://davidgoggins.com/), who is considered by many as Discipline himself. 

To increase your level in this skill, I think many people need to change their mindset. To read my point of view, see [[Thoughts on failure]]# and [[Thoughts on discomfort]]#.
