Listening to music while working is one of the best ideas if you want to reduce your productivity by 50%. Honestly, listening to rap or whatever should only be done when you want to relax without thinking about work.

- As an alternative, you can listen to music on [Brain.fm](https://brain.fm/) while working. It has a free trial, and then you can watch videos on their YouTube channel.
