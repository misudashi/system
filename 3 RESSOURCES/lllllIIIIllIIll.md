---------- 
Our brain generates many thoughts that follow each other, often without in a particular order or organization. The "good ideas" and creativity are the result of this autonomous production of thoughts.

This also means that it is necessary to let our brain "day-dream", and to let it think randomly without any goal. These calm moments allow our brain to re-organize its different synapses, and to regenerate them. Also see [[IIIIllllIIIIlll]].
