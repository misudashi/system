## Thoughts on discomfort
As a young man, you grow through discomfort. It's the discomfort that makes you more of a man. You should enjoy discomfort because it is the way to improve as a man. 

When you do sports, and you feel your muscles burning, you should enjoy that moment and convince yourself that you love that sensation. Become obsessed over this burning feeling, and you will get gains. The moment your muscles are burning is the crucial moment of your training, it is when you truly make gains.

"I don't count the sit-ups. I only start counting when it starts hurting because they're the only ones that count. That's what makes you a champion"
-Muhammad Ali
