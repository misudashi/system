----------
1. Acquire the language through context

Essentially, what he says in this part is that when you first hear a word, you will assume a meaning for it. But when you hear it in a 2nd context, and a third one, and a fourth one, you will eventually get the right meaning by associating them unconsciously.

2. Maximize Input

You will need to hear a word in many different contexts in order to understand it perfectly. So you will need to watch a lot of native content from the country you're learning. Simply reading the dictionary is nowhere near as efficient as watching with attention a native program.

3. Listen and pronounce

You can take one, two, three syllables and repeat it with the intonation and the accent. After a few hours, two words, three maybe. Then when you're really really fluent, a sentence ! It will allow you to get the accent and the intonations you should use in certain situations.
