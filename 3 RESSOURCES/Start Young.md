- The younger you start making businesses, the easier it is because you have much fewer things to lose.
- You have more free time.
It is quite logical because when you are old (or "old"), you have responsibilities: you need to provide food and a house for yourself (and potentially your family), and it is harder to give up everything to start growing a business out of nowhere. It can even lead to arguments with your friends and family because they don't understand why you do it. 

When you are young or at least younger, your parents fulfill all of your essential needs: they feed you, they give you a home, and you have access to electricity. You have much less to lose if you fail when you are younger.
