---------- 
What it states is that in a lot of cases in your life, those two numbers 80 and 20 will show. For instance, 20% of the clients of a company make 80% of their benefits.

You can use this to your advantage to focus on these 20% of clients. Though, focusing on something doesn't mean leaving the rest alone. You may not abandon the rest. You can use this in your every day life.

Please note that it's not always 80/20, but sometimes 95/5, 75/25...

I think that this rule can be really important and that we can use it in many ways. Essentially, It can be applied to all lots of things such as time managing.
