---------- 
Simplexity is the art of turning complex things into simple, readable, and understandable things.

Like "complex" shouldn't be confused with "complicated", "simplex" shouldn't be confused with "simple".

A "simplex thing" is a "complex thing to which we deconstructed the complexity in order to explain it simply."
