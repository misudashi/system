----------
Stacking something you need to do with something you want to do. It's useful because of the [[llllllllIIIIIIl|Craving]]that you will feel to do the thing you need to do after you've linked the two activities in your brain.

Example: 
- You need to lose weight and you love to watch shows on Netflix
- You only allow yourself to watch a show on Netflix if you are cycling on your appartment-bike at a certain speed.

This can be stacked with [[lIIllIIIIIIIlIl|Habit Stacking]]:

- After I drink my cup of coffee, I will get on my bike.
- After I get on my bike, I can watch a show on Netflix

To make it automatic and attractive.
