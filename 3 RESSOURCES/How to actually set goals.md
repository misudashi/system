## How to actually set goals



"Excitement is the more practical synonym for
happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive
to chase. It is the cure-all. When people suggest you
follow your “passion” or your “bliss,” I propose that they
are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept:
excitement.
This brings us full circle. The question you should be
asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are my goals?”
but “What would excite me?”"

-*Timothy Ferriss* in [[The 4 Hours Week by Timothy Ferriss]].

In other words, you should be aiming to achieve something exciting, because it will give you motivation.

I would like to add that your goals should be aligned with your [[Purpose]]#, which is one of the central topics of [[MOC Self Improvement]]. Keep in mind you'll need to [[Set unrealistic goals]].
