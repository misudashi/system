Habits won't last long if they don't make sense with *who you are*: Going to the gym a few times per week won't be a consistent thing for your whole life if you never start to believe you're an athlete.

Luckily, we can change our identities. 

> It is a simple two-step process:
> 1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
> 2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

Here, the small wins refer to the number of times you do a certain thing:

> Each time you write a page, you are a writer.
> Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.

-James Clear, [[atomic-habits|Atomic Habits]]

It is absolutely vital to always change your beliefs.

> Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
