Nowadays, "purpose" is a widely used word that can mean a lot of things. What I want to say by using this word is the "why". In order to correctly start your journey on [[self-improvement]], you should keep in mind that you will eventually find your Purpose. 

It is a greater thing, that gives you enough motivation to go through the trials and tribulations in order to reach peak happiness. 

If you can't find your purpose, you should probably do a [[IIIIIlllllIlllI]] with the difficulty at "Full" (this is important!). 

The famous YouTuber [Hamza](https://www.youtube.com/c/Hamza97), who is very popular amongst young men especially, came with a really good analogy that I will be trying to explain below:

"Life can be seen as an onion. Each layer of its skin is one Purpose. You need to find your *current* purpose, in order to accomplish it. Once you will have done this (it can take years), you will peel the layer of your onion. You will then find your next purpose, and continue peeling the layers until you reach the core of the onion: your "True Purpose".".
