## There is no definitive version of ourselves

There is no "definitive version" of ourselves. The one in which we were born, our "true self". 

Rather, we are constently evolving towards the spiritual perfection, through our personal experiences. At the beginning, there was no "true self" that wasn't influenced by the world around us. There's much more than this "true self": causes, and consequences.
