----------
The 4 elements described in [[lIIlIllIIlIIIll|The Habit Loop]] give us 4 laws:

Firstly, to create a Good Habit:

- The 1st law ([[lIlIlIIlIlIlIII|Cue]]): Make it obvious.
1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.
1.2: Use [[llIIIIIIllIIllI|Implementation Intention]]: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”
1.3: Use [[lIIllIIIIIIIlIl|Habit Stacking]]: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
1.4: Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible. ([[IIIllIlIIlIlIll|Becoming our own environment's architect]])

- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

Secondly, to eliminate a Bad Habit:
- Inversion of the 1st law ([[lIlIlIIlIlIlIII|Cue]]): Make it invisible.
Design your environment: put your gaming device in a closet.

- Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.
- Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.
- Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.

These 4 laws are the key to changing almost any behavior you want.
