## Décodez votre cerveau by Yves-Alexandre Thalmann

### Opinion
It's well written and I find it interesting. 

I would recommend it to anyone who can read French because I don't believe there is a translation. I'll give it an 8/10.

Here are a few important concepts of the book I didn't know:

- [[Neuroplasticity]]#
- [[The 5 Basic modules of our brain]]#
- [[The neutrality of our perception]]#
- [[The autonomous production of thoughts]]#
- [[The flow (the zone)]]#
- [[Using mind shortcuts]]#
- [[Creation of meanings to link the information to be memorized]]#
- [[The best way to learn]]#
- [[Our memories aren't true]]#
- [[Repetition is central to our learning]]#
- [[Neurogenesis]]#
- [[Superstitions]]#

- [[The Zeigarnik Effect]]#
- [[Attention is not an infinite resource]]#
