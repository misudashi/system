## Décodez votre cerveau by Yves-Alexandre Thalmann

### Opinion
So far, I'm enjoying the book. As I'm writing this, I'm about 50 pages in, and I've already learned lots of new things. I'll give it a second read where I will be noting every concept I acquire from it because there's almost a new one on every page! It's well written and I find it interesting. 

I would recommend it to anyone who can read French because I don't believe there is a translation. So far, easily 8/10. 

Here are a few important concepts of the book I didn't know:
- [[The Zeigarnik Effect]]#
- [[Attention is not an infinite resource]]#
