### Opinion
I enjoyed this book, I think it is great to acquire basic knowledge about minimalism. It is pretty easy to read, and it took me less than 3 hours to complete it while taking notes. I would recommend it, even for those who don't believe at all in minimalism. It definitely can bring something to your life.

I think it is called Minimalism: Living a meaningful life in English. You can buy it on Amazon for less than 8€. (7.28€ as I'm writing this).

Here are a few important concepts I noted while reading it :
- [[IIIllIlIlIIllII]]
- [[lllIIllllIllllI]]
- [[IIIllIIIlIlIIlI]]
- [[lllIIllIIIIIIII]]

The book talked about different aspects of minimalism. Of course, it talked about getting rid of objects that aren't useful to you, but I liked how it sort of got deeper into it. A piece of advice that was given was to also "get rid" of toxic relationships, which made me think deeply. I won't spoil the whole book though, because I truly think it is a must-read!
