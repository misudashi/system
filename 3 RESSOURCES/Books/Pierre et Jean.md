----------
- I read this book in French as a school task. 

- Maupassant's goal was to portray as best as possible the reality of life in this book, and it is what he did. Although his writing style is good in my opinion, I didn't like the story. 

- I don't really understand the point of writing a novel that is strictly reality: why not just going outside and living your life instead? I guess for the beauty of the artistic performance, which I respect.

- I'll give it a 4/10 for his writing style. I recommend reading it if you are interested in Maupassant's work or if you like this kind of novels.
