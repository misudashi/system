This book is a classic of [[self-improvement|Self Improvement]]. I highly recommend you buy it, open it to a random page, read a bit, and apply what you've just learned in the real world.

It's the quickest way to skyrocket your social skills, I guarantee it will work and you will start noticing progress in less than a week. 

10/10 so far.
