## Minimalisme by Joshua Field Miliburn and Ryan Nicodemus

### Opinion
I really enjoyed this book, I think it is great to acquire basic knowledge about minimalism. It is pretty easy to read, and it took me less than 3 hours to complete it while taking notes. I would recommend it, even for those who don't believe at all in minimalism. It definitely can bring something to your life.

I think it is called Minimalism : Living a meaningful life in English. You can buy it on Amazon for less than 8€. (7.28€ as I'm writing this).
