# Misudashi Systems

Hi, I'm [[Misudashi]]#. 

This website is my *Second Brain*, which contains a good part of all the knowledge I've acquired for the last few months in various topics, using **notes**.

## ðŸ“Œ How it works

The notes I take are similar to the ones of a [[Zettelkasten]] system, but the organization sometimes differs a  bit from the original concept.

If you're simply curious about all of this, I suggest you browse links, starting with the [[timeline]] and [Impulse](https://misudashi.ga/impulse) sections.

If you are here for some knowledge on a specific topic, then I would recommend using the **HUB**, which you can read more about in the next section.

## ðŸ“Œ HUB

For a better experience, I *try to* organize my notes in [Maps Of Content](https://justgage.github.io/moc.md). They can be seen as folders, but *better*.

For now, the hub points to 6 different Maps of Content:

- [[MOC Self Improvement]]#
- [[MOC Projects]]#
- [[MOC Notes]]#
- [[MOC Japanese]]#
- [[MOC Weekly Japanese Reviews]]#
- [[MOC The Human Brain]]#

## Credits

I want to thank [Morg](https://morg.systems/), who is the person that made me discover Neuron and this idea of sharing my notes. 

- This is possible because of [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/), a powerful tool with a welcoming community.
- To publish my notes, I use [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit them.
- Some notes I am taking can be highlights from what I've read. I do not pretend owning any of the stuff I write here, it is simply a database of my knowledge, so feel free to re-use it.

## Quick Disclaimer:

The Raw [[MOC Notes]]# may be messy, because they are meant to be re-read by myself so I can later turn them into permanent notes. They will often be filled with **Highlights**, which are the "interesting parts" I want to save in my memory when I read/listen to something. Thus, they can be in other languages such as French.

If you feel like what I am saying in these is incorrect, feel free to send me an e-mail so I can review what I wrote and potentially reformulate/correct what is said in there. (See [[Misudashi]])

Finally, as I previously said, 

> I do not pretend owning any of the stuff I write here, it is simply a database of my knowledge, so feel free to re-use it.

### If you would like to support me

If you like what I write here, and you would like to motivate me, you can donate to [**charities that matter to me**](https://www.google.com/search?q=i+want+to+donate+money+to+help+cervix+cancer+research.&source=lmns&bih=617&biw=414&prmd=niv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwic-u3R-ub5AhUPixoKHV-lB44Q_AUoAHoECAAQBA&pccc=1) *(thank you !)*


*Hope you will enjoy it.*
