# Misudashi Systems

Hi, I'm [[myself]]#. 

This is my personal website, in which I write what I learn or think.

## ðŸ“Œ How it works

The notes I take are similar to the ones of a [[IIIIIIIllllIllI]] system, but the organization sometimes differs a  bit from the original concept.

If you're simply curious about all of this, I suggest you browse links, starting with the [[timeline]] and [Impulse](https://misudashi.ga/impulse) sections.

If you are here for some knowledge on a specific topic, then I would recommend using the **HUB**, which you can read more about in the next section.

## ðŸ“Œ HUB

For a better experience, I organize my notes in [Maps Of Content](https://justgage.github.io/moc.md). They can be seen as folders.

For now, the hub points to 6 different Maps of Content: [[IIlIIIlIIlIllll|A Brief Introduction to Degeneracy and the Beginning of Modern Dark Ages]]

- [[self-improvement]]#
- [[projects]]#
- [[notes]]#
- [[japanese]]#
- [[weekly-japanese-reviews]]#
- [[neurosciences-and-psychology]]#

## Credits

-  [Morg](https://morg.systems/) made me discover Neuron through his website.
- I use [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) to change my .md files to web pages.
- To publish my notes, I use [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit them.
- **Some notes I am taking can be highlights from what I've read. I do not pretend owning any of the stuff I write here, it is simply a database of my knowledge, so feel free to re-use it.**

### Donating

I do not accept donations or sponsorships because running this website is free, and I do not own 100% of the content posted here due to Highlights.
