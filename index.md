# Misudashi's 2nd Brain

Hi, I am Misudashi. Welcome to my personal website, that I call my **2nd Brain** (fancy name) !

This is possible because of [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/), a powerful tool I have been using since 
*Saturday, 13th of August 2022*. 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are used in my case to publish my notes.

## Why ?

I have been taking notes on various apps, such as *Obsidian, Notion, Apple Notes, and even OpenOffice files at one point*. 
I realized that it would be interesting to share my point of view on some subjects, and to share my knowledge with others, so I decided to create this.

You can view this place as my own personal blog, but at the same time, a place where I share everything I know about the subjects I'm interested in. 

**If I can make one as happy as I am writing this, then my day is made !**

## Credits

I want to thank [Morg](https://morg.systems/), who is the person that made me discover Neutron and this idea of sharing my notes after I clicked a random profile on Discord and saw this link.

## How to properly browse this site

If you are simply curious about what I've been thinking or doing lately, you can randomly browse articles through [links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

If you are trying to get more knowledge about a specific topic, I recommend taking a look at the **HUB**, where you will be able to browse through my notes & articles with more controle.

## HUB

For now, the hub points to three categories of notes :
- [Languages]()
- [Self Improvement]()
- [Miscellaneous]()
- [[daily-notes]]

## Disclaimer :

The [[daily-notes]] may contain sensitive and/or controversial topics. They are meant to be re-read by myself so I can eventually elaborate them further and turn them into articles. I will be talking about every topics you can imagine, without filters.

### If you would like to support me..

The greatest thing you can do to support me is to buy yourself a coffee. 

I do not accept donations because running this website is free, and I do not write the content I post here to be part of a business. This way, you also know that I really say what I think ;) !

More seriously, if you don't really know what to do with your money, you can donate to [**charities that matter to me**](https://www.google.com/search?q=I+want+to+donate+money+to+help+cancer+research.&oq=I+want+to+donate+money+to+help+cancer+research.&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.17103j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) *(thank you !)*


### Daily notes

Finally, if you want to see the rawest notes I will be taking, you can read my [[daily-notes]].
