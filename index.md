# Misudashi Systems

Hi, I am [[Misudashi]]#. Welcome to my website, which I call my **2nd Brain** *(fancy name)*

Here, you can view my whole [[Zettelkasten]] System, which contains everything I have ever created, read, watched, or thought.

## ðŸ“Œ How it works

If you're simply curious about all of this, I suggest you browse links, starting with the [Impulse](https://misudashi.github.io/systems/impulse) section.

If you are here for some knowledge on a specific topic, then I would recommend using the **HUB**, which you can read more about in the next section.

## ðŸ“Œ HUB

For a better experience, I *try to* organize my notes in [Maps Of Content](https://justgage.github.io/moc.md). They can be seen as folders, but *better*.

For now, the hub points to 6 different categories :
- [[MOC Languages]]#
- [[MOC Self Improvement]]#
- [[MOC Notes]]#
- [[MOC Weekly Japanese Reviews]]#
- [[MOC Projects]]#
- [[MOC Music]]#

## Credits

I want to thank [Morg](https://morg.systems/), who is the person that made me discover Neuron and this idea of sharing my notes. I clicked your profile randomly after you helped me with Japanese via the English-Japanese Exchange Server on Discord.

- This is possible because of [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/), a powerful tool with a welcoming community.
- To publish my notes, I use [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit them.
- Some notes I am taking can be highlights from what I've read. I do not pretend owning any of the stuff I write here, it is simply a database of my knowledge, so feel free to re-use it.

After using Obsidian for a few weeks, I thought it would be pretty cool to share the knowledge I acquire with others. 

**If you learn anything while browsing my notes, then my day is made.**

## About Raw Notes:

The Raw [[MOC Notes]]# may contain sensitive and/or controversial topics. They are meant to be re-read by myself so I can eventually elaborate on them further and turn them into longer notes, which I refer to as "articles". I will be talking about every topic you can imagine, without filters. 

**Though**, if you feel like what I am saying in these is incorrect, feel free to send me an e-mail so I can review what I wrote and potentially reformulate/correct what is said in there. (See [[Misudashi]])

Raw Notes will often also be filled with **Highlights**, which are the *Interesting Parts* I want to save in my memory when I read something, to eventually reformulate so they can be part of my 2nd Brain. Some of these highlights may be in foreign languages such as French, or Japanese.

### If you would like to support me

If you like what I write here, and you would like to motivate me, you can donate to [**charities that matter to me**](https://www.google.com/search?q=i+want+to+donate+money+to+help+cervix+cancer+research.&source=lmns&bih=617&biw=414&prmd=niv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwic-u3R-ub5AhUPixoKHV-lB44Q_AUoAHoECAAQBA&pccc=1) *(thank you !)*


*Hope you will enjoy it!*
