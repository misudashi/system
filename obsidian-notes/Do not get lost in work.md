# Do not get lost in work and duties

The best advice you feel receive to be more productive and stop procrastinating is **do a timetable**.

But sometimes, you need to stop watching that timetable and just look at the horizon.

Visualize your mother's death, your friend killing himself, your bigger purpose, your own death..

Because when you will see your friend again, you will just want to hug him and tell him you love him.
