# Remarque à propos des différents échecs que je peux rencontrer au cours de mon périple de Self Improvement

Everytime I experience failing, I'm always like 
"Oh yeah but I'll get that better with the time that passes"

The truth is that I'm kind of putting this work I should be doing now on my future-self, and I unconsciously think that it will fix by itself eventually.
The reality is that I and my future-self are the same person, and if I never work on something I failed on, it will never be fixed. 
So everytime I experience a failure, should I feel ashamed of it, and should it be a motivation so the next time I'm about to skip meditation or whatever, I think of the shame I felt after I skipped it ? 
Or should I accept that sometimes you fail and "that's okay" ?
