# A superior Man lives outside of his comfort zone

Sometimes we are proud because we go talk to a girl or whatever, and for a moment we are out of our comfort zone.

What Hamza says here is that a superior man **lives** outside of his comfort zone.
He does this so often that we can literally say he lives outside his comfort zone.
