# The importance of praising people around you

When your mom has cooked something good, imagine how good she would feel, how warm her heart would be if you told her "This food is amazing, I am so grateful for this. Thank you, I love you."

You can do this with your friends, with your girlfriend, with anyone that does something good, you can actually tell them "This was good. I thank you for this."

It may feel a bit cringe at the beginning, but it will make them so happy that it is entirely worth it.
