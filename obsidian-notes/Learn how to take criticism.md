# Criticism

Quand un ami te critique, pose-toi cette question : 

*"Is he a Jeffrey or an Adonis ?"*

Because Jeffreys criticise you to bring you down, so you should not listen to them.
Adonis friends criticise you out of love, because they want you to be a better man. 

So when a friend criticises you, think of is it a good criticise or is it a bad one ?
If your friend is an Adonis, pay attention to it. It will make you feel a bit insecure but it will be really important and it will make you grow.
