# Your Purpose must come Before your Relationship

In this part of the video, Hamza says that a lot of people that have been working on themselves and that have been on self-improvement follow this :

1) : Be an unattractive person
2) : Work on yourself and get to your prime in physical and mental health, wealth, and they find their purpose
3) : Get in a relationship and kind of forget their purpose
4) : The girl is not as attracted anymore because you lost your purpose, and that was one of the reasons why she was so in love with you
5) And Restart

He even says that sometimes, when he realized a girl he truly loved was an obstacle to his true purpose, he left her and now he's grateful for what he did.
