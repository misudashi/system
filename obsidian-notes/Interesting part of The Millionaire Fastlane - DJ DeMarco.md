# This shows that the Slowlane uses Time and it's not a good thing in the wealth equation



Notice that intrinsic value is measured in units of TIME. This “time attachment”
introduces the Slowlane’s first punitive element of wealth creation. Can you
control time? Can you leverage time? You can’t. Your time is limited to 24 hours
of exchange. If you earn $200/hour, you can’t miraculously demand to work 400
hours in one day. If you earn $50,000/year, you can’t miraculously demand to
work 400 years in your life. Time has no leverage.
For the hourly worker, your maximum upper limit is 24 hours, and guess what.
There’s nothing you can do to change this limit. In theory, you can trade 24 hours
of your day for income, but you can’t trade more. Of course, working 24 hours a
day is humanly impossible, so 8 to 12 hours per day are traded.
For the salaried worker, the prohibition is the same. You can’t work more years
than your normal life expectancy. What is the upper limit of this exchange? Forty,
fifty years? In all of recorded history, no human has ever worked 10,000 years of
his or her life. Whether you’re paid hourly or annually—it doesn’t matter—you
can’t leverage time!
Consider this. Is 12 a large number? Or 50? Are these numbers predisposed to
create millionaires? They aren’t, and it exposes why the mathematics of a job are
wealth punitive: Your time is limited to small numbers and cannot be leveraged.
“Hours worked” or “annual salary” are mathematically inept because they’re based
on time measurements that cannot be controlled or manipulated. Mathematics
doesn’t lie; 12 will always be less than 10,000,000. If leverage is limited, so is
wealth creation. Small numbers do not make millionaires.
Behind limited leverage is another corrosive wealth killer—no control. Can you
control your employer? Can you control your salary? Can you control the economy?
Can you earn $50,000 one year and next year bank $50 million? Can you control
anything about your job, including your measly 4% pay raise? You might think
you can by job-hopping, but you can’t. Control is weak, if not absent.

## Compound Interest: What “They” Don’t Tell You
The second variable in the Slowlane wealth equation is the “primary wealth accelerator,”
which comes from market investments like mutual funds, 401Ks, and other
traditional investments touted by gurus and financial advisers. These investments
use the financial strategy known as “compound interest,” which is a mathematical
construct that outlines the power of interest accumulation over great periods of time.
The fundamental sell of compound interest is the old guru swan song regurgitated
ad nauseum: $10,000 invested today will be worth gazillions in 40 years. Invest
$250 a month for 50 years and you will retire rich! Used correctly, “compound
interest” is a powerful ally to wealth; used for Slowlane purposes and it dredges
the wealth road trip to a crawl. Why? Again, the puzzle is solved if you exploit the
math—the answer plays sibling to why a job won’t make you rich: time.
Wealth creation via compound interest requires the passing of time and lots
of it. Like a job, compound interest, or market investments such as mutual funds
and 401Ks, can’t be leveraged nor can they be controlled. They rely on deficient
math to create wealth.
Inasmuch as the income you make in a job is measured in an hourly rate or
an annual salary, the wealth acceleration process of “compound interest” is also
measured in time (years) multiplied by a yearly yield.
