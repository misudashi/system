# Purpose

You need to peel back the layers of your purpose.

=> What is my purpose ? 

My purpose is to be wealthy enough to I can guarantee my family has to never work again. I need to put my parents in security. 

When you have reached your purpose, you need to find the next layer.

**How to find your purpose?**

To find your purpose, you need to turn everything off, phone, computer etc, and stare at your wall for 6hours, 3 days, doesn't matter. You will, with your brain processing, find your purpose.
