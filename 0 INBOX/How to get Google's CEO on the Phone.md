## How to get Google's CEO on the Phone

“I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if
possible, often through their little-known personal
blogs, send a two- to three-paragraph e-mail which
explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one
simple-to-answer but thought-provoking question in
that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies.
The goal is to start a dialogue so they take the time to
answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can
only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail
exchanges."
