**Summary**:
- Fight Club doesn't represent the perfect criticism of the consumer society.
- The Fight Club wasn't a good example of anarchism for a long time.
- David Fincher (the film's director) has a very pessimistic view of the human condition.
- Tyler Durden isn't as deep as we like to think.

**Fight Club doesn't represent the perfect criticism of the consumer society.**

When we watch Fight Club for the first time, we generally think that the movie represents the perfect criticism of it.

I like to think that David Fincher is cynical when he criticises the consumer society, because there are **tons** of references to brands such as Gucci, and although it was described in an unfriendly manner by Tyler Durden, it is likely that they were paid to make it appear. 

David Fincher criticises the consumer society in Fight Club to benefit from it by selling more copies of the movie, which really demonstrates that even the "enemies" of consumerism end up embracing it to some degree. That truly is what's cool about the movie.

**The Fight Club wasn't a good example of anarchism for a long time.**

If we pay a little closer attention while watching, we can think that it actually promotes anarchism to some degree: the Fight Club is a place where the state has no power. Personally, I even assimilated the Club to the 90s' "free parties" for some time, where, for a few hours or days, there aren't any rules or leaders. But there's something wrong with this too.

Firstly, Tyler gives it a name, and rules: "The first rule of Fight Club is..."". If he really wanted to create a place in which there are no leaders, taxes, rules, etc, he wouldn't have done that. (Or maybe Tyler isn't as smart and as deep as we like to think?). Finally, he even created a terrorist organisation called "Project Mayhem", which clearly has a leader, and rules.

**My opinion is that David Fincher (the film's director) has a very pessimistic view of the human condition.**

I already wrote it earlier, but because the film demonstrates that even those who want to "escape consumerism and order" end up following it in some way or another, and because the movie still proves consumerism and order are not the right system, I think the director has a pessimistic view of the human condition. I haven't heard him saying that though, so he may have another explanation.

**Tyler Durden isn't as deep as we like to think.**

A lot of people like the character of Durden because he is a masculine man, who seems detached from the society and who leads something as complex as a terrorist organisation. In reality, Tyler probably isn't smart, and he is simply impulsive and nihilistic. There are also many times where he contradicts himself, like when he says he has in front of him brilliant men, then proceeds to tell the men of the Project Mayhem (the same men) that they aren't special.
