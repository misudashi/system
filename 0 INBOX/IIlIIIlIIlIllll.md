----------
I would like to write an essay.

Disclaimer: 
	Explain how my point of view is purely personal, how I am patriotic which may have biased me in my argumentation, and how I would love to hear other people's opinions

Introduction: 
	Show shocking stats which trigger people's attention and explain the question i'm gonna try to answer: In which ways are we going to our loss without even noticing?

I) The illusion of power modern society blindly adopted
	Explain how we think our western countries are safe. Show how weak modern western men are, which directly makes our countries unsafe. Show the problems with China's plans, TikTok and degeneracy => nice transition to II)
II) What a normal civilization should look like and how far we are from it
	Explain how eastern countries, especially muslim ones, stayed in a sort of older way of thinking which make them stronger than us.
III) How western countries are going to their loss: the beginning of modern dark ages
	Expose the whole truth, and my personal views on how we can work towards fixing this problem. (SI, communities...)

Conclusion
	Briefly talk about the 3 axes and make an opening on the future of the world

For thousands of years, the human race invented new technologies to improve its daily life. Our ancestors probably couldn't even imagine how good our lives are, in the 21st century, compared to theirs. But surprisingly, the [crime](https://crimerate.co.uk/london/city-of-london#city-of-london-historical-crime-rates), [suicide](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/images/databriefs/401-450/db433-fig1.png), and [depression](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2022/03/24/research-update-childrens-anxiety-and-depression-on-the-rise/) rates all show the exact opposite: as time goes by, it is undeniable that the western society is deteriorating. The statistics prove men are technically getting weaker: dead, and depressed men won't figh as much for their country as their ancestors did. In which ways are we going to our loss without noticing? Firstly, we will see that we have been fed an illusion of power we blindly adopted. Secondly, we will compare our society with what it should be looking like. Finally, how what we are living marks the beginning of modern dark ages.

When wars were still a thing in Europe, strong men were needed for a nation to survive. Today, the majority of us feel plus or less safe in western countries: the crime rates, although increasing, are low. There are no more wars inside our territories. With the development of nuclear weapons, we believe we are free of defending our country. It is even rare these days to find someone on the streets who is willing to fight for his nation. This leads to a general negative attitude towards masculinity, pride, strenght, patriotism, and other traits. Because we don't need strong men anymore, we tend to stop encouraging them to exist in the first place. In 'The Art of War, Sun Tzu' said "Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.". Ironically enough, this strategy is being used in the present day by his own nation, China. Matrix
