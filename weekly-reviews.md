# Weekly Reviews (WR)

I will be mainly doing Japanese Reports in these reviews, but they may also contain pieces of articles I am currently writing, or my thoughts on more precise topics. 

The raw notes may contain sensitive and/or controversial topics. They are meant to be re-read by myself so I can eventually elaborate them further and turn them into articles. I will be talking about every topics you can imagine, without filters.

Also, I originally thought of that as Daily Notes. That's why you have 3 consecutive Reviews, and that's also why they're a bit messy.
