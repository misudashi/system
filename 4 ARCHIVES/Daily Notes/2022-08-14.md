## Morning Thoughts
It is 7:38 right now, and I just thought that it would be a good idea to write about my personal experience on meditation, and its benefits as a teenager. I should do that a little bit later in the day if I remember. For now, I'm going to learn Japanese grammar as I can officially start my training.

I wrote yesterday that I was going to test myself again on Kana but I don't actually think I will do that.. I spent like 40 minutes answering easy questions. I'll just try to practice it in my everyday life and we should be good to go.

## Japanese

I'm actually following [Mog's Learning Loop](https://morg.systems/58465ab9), and since I finished learning Kana, I can now focus on grammar.

I did a few things. First, I fixed my Police (going from Chinese to Japanese).
I set up Yomichan extension for chrome.
I'm going to follow [Sakubi's Guide](https://sakubi.neocities.org/#) on Grammar.

I discovered a website called [Jisho](https://jisho.org/) which will allow me to look up words that I don't know.

I started using Anki and it looks pretty good for now, not gonna lie. I'm using [this deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/911122782) which uses anime. I highly recommend it. 
You can look at its features [here](https://www.japanese-like-a-breeze.com/guide-for-beginners/) or alternatively on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYrc_KTvfE).

I should start reading [Tae Kim's Grammar Book](http://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar), because apparently everyone is recommending it. (The author of the Anki deck I'm using, Sakubi, and Mog.)

Using Anki I discovered there are many ways to apologize in Japanese which are covered [here](https://maggiesensei.com/2010/05/18/%E3%81%94%E3%82%81%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA%E3%81%95%E3%81%84%E8%A8%B1%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E4%B8%8B%E3%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%80%82gomennasaiyurushite-kudasai-how-to-apologize-in-japanese/).

Once I am a little bit more familiar with Anki, I should have a look into [its best settings](https://morg.systems/31f3d49a).

For now, I will be simply reading Sakubi's Guide on Grammar. I found something interesting that I may need to get further into : [pronouns](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/945027080037498890/1008427896056057917/unknown.png).

For today, I will try to remember わたし (watashi).

I'm going to stop learning Japanese for today as it is already 8pm and I have tons of things to do. It is really interesting tho.

**Note to myself :** I am [this far](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/945027080037498890/1008439474428059688/unknown.png) into Sakubi's Guide on Grammar.

## S-I

An online friend of mine posted [a nice pdf](https://vie-etudiante.uqam.ca/medias/fichiers/conseils-soutien/article-estime-de-soi.pdf) on Discord that is written in french. I may translate it so you guys can enjoy it, because it is really short and I think it covers an interesting topic on self-esteem.
