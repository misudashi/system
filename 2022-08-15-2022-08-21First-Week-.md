# 2022-08-15  - 2022-08-21 (First Week)

So that's it ! Here is the first week of my journey on learning Japanese. I already have some *weak weak* basics : I used Duolingo to learn Kana. I have a Anki Mining Deck set up, and I learned +- how to use it. I will be first learning basic Grammar using [Sakubi's Guide](https://sakubi.neocities.org/#) on the topic. When I feel like it is not enough anymore, I will switch on Tae Kim's guide. On the vocabulary part, I'm learning **a lot** everytime I read anything online, pretty much. I also watched the Pitch Tone basic introduction recommended by [Morg](https://morgs.systems).

## Chatting

Today I posted one sentence in a discord server where people speak Japanese. One single sentence. My first sentence in Japanese. I have no bases in Grammar, and I didn't use any in it anyway. I used the vocabulary I already know. Ready for this sentence ? Alright. I wanted to say "Please talk to me". 

[This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945027080037498890/1008769038572327052/unknown.png) is how it ended. Listen. I have **absolutely no idea** how I created this sentence. But alright. Anyway, the answers were pretty funny, and people were surprisingly willing to help me. I was told a lot of sentences, and I was able to add a lot of things into my Anki Deck.

Also I just realized while typing this that so far, I haven't given any context in every single Kanji I put in my deck. I might want to do that now actually.
