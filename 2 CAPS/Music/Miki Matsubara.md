## Miki Matsubara

Miki Matsubara (松原みき) is a [[City Pop]] Japanese singer and composer. She is known worldwide for some of her songs, such as Mayonaka no Door (Stay With Me), and Neat na gogo san-ji. 

### Biography
Miki was born in 1959, in Kishiwada. Her mom was a jazz singer for Crazy Cats, which was a jazz/comedy band. Miki started playing the piano at 3 years old. She was getting good grades at school and her family expected her to continue studying, but she decided to move alone to Tokyo to become a singer. She was noticed by Yuzura Sera, a Japanese pianist, in various places in Tokyo. She made her first single, Mayonaka no Door in 1979, which is also her most famous piece.  She then continued her music career, with a total of 16 singles and 10 original albums. 

As you listen to her songs, you will notice an undeniable Jazz side that goes well with her warm voice, which is pretty unexpected but contributes to the uniqueness of the artist.

### Death
"In the year 2000, after being unreachable for some time, she sent an unexpected email to her close friends, family, and record labels stating that she couldn’t go on with her music career and would not be communicating with anyone via phone or email ever again. Shortly after, she ceased working on music and faded from public view without notice or explanation.

A year later it was made known she had been diagnosed with cancer requiring her to begin treatments for the affliction. She spent the last few years of her life battling cancer and trying to overcome the illness that came with it. Tragically, on October 7, 2004, she succumbed and passed away at the age of 44.

Miki was a very private individual and stayed out of the spotlight to a degree that not much is known about her personal life. Her death was announced to the general public two months after the fact. Not much was found to be said by the media or her remaining family, and it’s not certain what statements remain regarding her unfortunate circumstances leading to her death.

It was commented by someone familiar with the circumstances revolving around her last months that she had regretted her music career due to not having enough time to focus on living her life more fully, unknowingly heading toward an inevitable end that would come too soon."
