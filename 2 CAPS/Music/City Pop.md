## City Pop

City pop (シティーポップ) is a sub-genre of J-Pop, itself inspired by occidental pop & rock (The Beattles, Beach Boys, ..). It was born on the late 70s, and reached its apogee in the 80s , before declining. Lately, it gained back in popularity because of the Internet, and especially TikTok *via* different trends.
