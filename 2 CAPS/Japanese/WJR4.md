# WJR4 17 Oct. -  24 Oct. 2022

## Manga 漫画
I downloaded [the scans of よつばと!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jcCUZOxOgJz0qxmUz5aMmITIo5IaaP-0) after seeing a YouTube video talk about it. From what I've understood so far, it seems that よつば is a young girl who's moving houses. I figured that out because I saw 「ここ家がいっぱい」, in which I recognized 「家」 and 「ここ」. I learned a new way of saying 「すごい」, which is 「すげえ」. I had to look up the word in order to realize they were the same. The manga seems pretty cool, and honestly not too hard to read. Though, I doubt that it will be a practical way to learn Japanese, due to the fact that I'm reading it using a scan, which makes it impossible to select a word and copy-paste it into [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/), or to use Yomichan, making things extra-difficult when there is a sentence I don't understand at all. I think I would rather study Japanese texts on a website, so I can quickly look up things when I want to.

## Japanese TV Shows 日本のテレビ番組
### [TORE]((https://youtu.be/7By_AJfrnrw)
この日本のテレビ番組はゲームをする番組です。そのゲームでは伏せられた平仮名を推測して当てます。

The participants were in front of a brick wall, and when it was their turn, they were supposed to guess the missing 平仮名 of a word. The more time they took, the more a brick behind them would go forward, forcing them to adopt funny positions to avoid falling into the void. I enjoyed watching it because the participants had funny reactions. I didn't understand everything, but it didn't remove the fun from the show. After finishing it, I clicked on the YouTube profile of the person who posted it to see if there was a next part, but I didn't find any. I also noticed this episode had been recorded more than 10 years ago! The participants are probably more than 30 now!

Spoiler Alert! - If you want to watch the show before reading this, [click here](https://youtu.be/7By_AJfrnrw).

Eventually, everyone except one team was eliminated, so I think they won. I recognized some words such as　おんせん (which means bathing facilities). I found it pretty fun, and it convinced me even more to start watching more random 日本のテレビ番組. If you want to watch it, [here's a link](https://youtu.be/7By_AJfrnrw). After watching the episode 2 (the one I just talked about being the 3rd one), I realized that the whole テレビ番組 was based around Indiana Jones. This time, the candidates were only three and they were on a platform that was rotating vertically. There were two different minigames, the first one being to simply jump from small platform to another, and the second one being to find the 平仮名 of a word, using small drawings that were supposed to help them. I did enjoy this episode, but my favorite character "died" pretty quickly because he made a dumb mistake. I find it pretty funny how they make the candidates "die". Instead of simply falling in water, or out of the camera's field of view, they literally fell into the void, disappearing in darkness while hearing their voice fade away. I wonder how they did that. Probably using blue screens? 

### ["Ice Staircase Race"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHXKJqQp-Is&t=330s)

この日本のテレビ番組は短いです。It was very funny, because the candidates kept making others fall everytime they failed to reach the top. As I said, it was pretty short, and I think it's also a very popular clip on social media, but it's always good to review your classics ;)

## Web Articles ニュース記事
I tried doing random researches on the Internet to browse web pages. I ended up reading a Wikipedia page about the roman emperors, and daily weather in Japan. I actually picked up some words, and I was very surprised I could sometimes even get a general idea of what a sentence meant (without using Yomichan). I think I'm getting a bit better at it, and that's awesome.

I also found this awesome website named [New Web Easy](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/article/disaster_rain.html), which rewrites web articles in simpler Japanese so beginners can understand them. I can't thank them enough, because it actually makes it fun to read random stuff now! Also, since it is a website, I can use Yomichan, which saves a ton of time. I really want to start mining words, but on the other hand I am scared of burning out. I may start by getting 1, 2, or 3 new words per day in addition to my current N5 deck in Anki. 

### ["最近ほめられていない取材班がほめる大切さを取材してみた"](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20221019/k10013863591000.html)

この ニュース記事は 学生と先生の関係についてのものです。I didn't understand everything, but I think the article talked about a "method" which is called 「ほめ育」, which consists in complementing more the your students to have a better relationship with them.


## Pitch accent training
I also trained my pitch accent using [this test](https://kotu.io/tests/pitchAccent/minimalPairs).

Here is my score out of 100 tries so far. I'll keep updating it as I get better at it, my goal to get anywhere from 95 to 100% correct answers.
