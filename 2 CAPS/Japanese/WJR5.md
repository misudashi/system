## Short Stories
I've read a couple of short stories made by [YomuJp](https://yomujp.com) and I was surprised by how pleasant it is. It's rare when I can just read something and understand what's happening without looking up too many words. And the stories aren't just boring and interesting texts, me discover parts of Japan I didn't know. I think it is a great initiative, because it actually makes mining interesting for beginners, which is hard.
