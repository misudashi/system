After a small break for my holidays, where the only Japanese I was learning was through Duolingo because I didn't have any time, I'm back and I'm more determined than ever to make some good progress !

## A note on Duolingo

While I think Duolingo is great to get started without much effort, I have drastically decreased the time I spend on the app, replacing it by native japanese content as well as real courses (grammar, and vocabulary). 

I will keep my streak because why not, but I don't think the app will make me progress that much compared to other ressources available to me right now.

## HelloTalk
I downloaded HelloTalk, but I have to say I'm not a huge fan of it because the only thing I can say is こんにちは、はじめまして、ミスダシです, which you will probably agree with me isn't enough to start a conversation online. 

I will give it a 2nd look once I am a little bit more familiar with Japanese.

## Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
I watched 2 Episodes of Jojo's today, but this time I put the subtitles in Japanese instead of English. I have to admit it is much harder, but I think I will progress faster. 

I am really enjoying the anime so far. Easily  9/10, the action is great, it has good drawings, good voice acting and even more importantly a good story. I am still on Joseph's part, and I have to say I like him less than Jonathan, even though he is a great character. 

[ SPOILER ] - I think there were nazis, and something to do with a huge, really powerful creature (as expected watching Jojo's). I think it just got killed by the sun in a well (why not afterall). 

I enjoy the characters, especially the old guy in a wheelchair, and I believe he is named Speedwagon (スピードワゴン) but I'm not 100% sure about that either. Even if I don't understand half the plot, Jojo's is so well made it is still highly enjoyable. I'm looking forward for the next episodes, but I only allow myself 2 episodes per day to avoid binge watching. (It would make it less fun, and I need to stay productive !)
