## WJR4 17 Oct. -  24 Oct. 2022

#### よつばと！(漫画)
I downloaded [the scans of よつばと!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jcCUZOxOgJz0qxmUz5aMmITIo5IaaP-0) after seeing a YouTube video talk about it. 

#### Yuta's Japanese Guide

I went through a few videos of my man Yuta Aoki and I have to admit it, he explains things quite well. I've taken 2 notes already (which you can see in [[Japanese]]). I have watched a few videos of his, and I like the structure of his lessons. 

The only thing I can criticize is him insisting a lot on how you should buy his courses (which I respect). 

#### Browsing the Internet

The main reason why I wasn't able to consume a lot of native content is because I was too busy. (Like actually, no excuses being made). But whenever I had 5 minutes of free time this week, I tried doing random researches on the Internet and to browse the pages. 

I ended up reading a Wikipedia page about the roman emperors, and daily weather in Japan. I actually picked up some words, and I was very surprised I could sometimes even get a general idea of what a sentence meant. I think I'm getting a bit better at it, and that's awesome. That means that I should really continue doing that, in addition to the daily Anki (and Duolingo) sessions. My goal for now would be to get about 30 minutes of Japanese content in per day.

#### 日本のテレビ番組
この日本のテレビ番組はゲームをする番組です。そのゲームでは伏せられた平仮名を推測して当てます。

The participants were in front of a brick wall, and when it was their turn, they were supposed to guess the missing 平仮名 of a word. The more time they took, the more a brick behind them would go forward, forcing them to adopt funny positions to avoid falling into the void. 

I enjoyed watching it because the participants had funny reactions. I didn't understand everything, but it didn't remove the fun from the show. After finishing it, I clicked on the YouTube profile of the person who posted it to see if there was a next part, but I didn't find any. I also noticed this episode had been recorded more than 10 years ago! The participants are probably more than 30 now!

Spoiler Alert! - If you want to watch the show before reading this, [click here](https://youtu.be/7By_AJfrnrw).

Eventually, everyone except one team was eliminated, so I think they won. I recognized some words such as　おんせん (which mean bathing facilities). I found it pretty fun, and it convinced me even more to start watching more random 日本のテレビ番組. If you want to watch it, [here's a link](https://youtu.be/7By_AJfrnrw). 

After watching the episode 2 (the one I just talked about being the 3rd one), I realized that the whole テレビ番組 was based around Indiana Jones. This time, the candidates were only three and they were on a platform that was rotating vertically. There were two different minigames, the first one being to simply jump from small platform to another, and the second one being to find the 平仮名 of a word, using small drawings that were supposed to help them. 

I did enjoy this episode, but my favorite character "died" pretty quickly because he made a dumb mistake. 

I find it pretty funny how they made the candidates "die". Instead of simply falling in water, or out of the camera's field of view, they literally fell into the void, disappearing in darkness while hearing their voice fade away. I wonder how they did that. Probably using blue screens?
