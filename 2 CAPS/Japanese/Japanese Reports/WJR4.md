## Manga 漫画
I downloaded [the scans of よつばと!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jcCUZOxOgJz0qxmUz5aMmITIo5IaaP-0) after seeing a YouTube video talk about it. From what I've understood so far, it seems that よつば is a young girl who's moving houses. I figured that out because I saw 「ここ家がいっぱい」, in which I recognized 「家」 and 「ここ」. I learned a new way of saying 「すごい」, which is 「すげえ」. I had to look up the word in order to realize they were the same. The manga seems pretty cool, and honestly not too hard to read. Though, I doubt that it will be a practical way to learn Japanese, due to the fact that I'm reading it using a scan, which makes it impossible to select a word and copy-paste it into [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/), or to use Yomichan, making things extra-difficult when there is a sentence I don't understand at all. I think I would rather study Japanese texts on a website, so I can quickly look up things when I want to.

## Japanese TV Shows 日本のテレビ番組
### [TORE](https://youtu.be/7By_AJfrnrw)
この日本のテレビ番組はゲームをする番組です。そのゲームでは伏せられた平仮名を推測して当てます。

The participants were in front of a brick wall, and when it was their turn, they were supposed to guess the missing 平仮名 of a word. The more time they took, the more a brick behind them would go forward, forcing them to adopt funny positions to avoid falling into the void. I enjoyed watching it because the participants had funny reactions. I didn't understand everything, but it didn't remove the fun from the show. After finishing it, I clicked on the YouTube profile of the person who posted it to see if there was a next part, but I didn't find any. I also noticed this episode had been recorded more than 10 years ago! The participants are probably more than 30 now!

Spoiler Alert! - If you want to watch the show before reading this, [click here](https://youtu.be/7By_AJfrnrw).

Eventually, everyone except one team was eliminated, so I think they won. I recognized some words such as　おんせん (which means bathing facilities). I found it pretty fun, and it convinced me even more to start watching more random 日本のテレビ番組. If you want to watch it, [here's a link](https://youtu.be/7By_AJfrnrw). After watching the episode 2 (the one I just talked about being the 3rd one), I realized that the whole テレビ番組 was based around Indiana Jones. This time, the candidates were only three and they were on a platform that was rotating vertically. There were two different minigames, the first one being to simply jump from small platform to another, and the second one being to find the 平仮名 of a word, using small drawings that were supposed to help them. I did enjoy this episode, but my favorite character "died" pretty quickly because he made a dumb mistake. I find it pretty funny how they make the candidates "die". Instead of simply falling in water, or out of the camera's field of view, they literally fell into the void, disappearing in darkness while hearing their voice fade away. I wonder how they did that. Probably using blue screens? 

### [Ice Staircase Race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHXKJqQp-Is&t=330s)

この日本のテレビ番組は短いです。It was very funny, because the candidates kept making others fall everytime they failed to reach the top. As I said, it was pretty short, and I think it's also a very popular clip on social media, but it's always good to review your classics ;)

### [Wall of Boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGsgSJ5ZQaY)
Wall of Boxesという日本のTV Gameshowで、参加者は壁の上にいて、数字を選ばなければなりませんでした。
数字を選ぶたびに違うイベントが起こり、壁の一部が破壊されていきます。
最後に自分の壁に立っていた参加者が勝ちです。
浜田さんは高所恐怖症なので、とても怖かったそうですが、勇気を出してゲームに参加しました。

## YouTube ユーチューブ
I discovered a wholesome YouTube channeいつnamed Watercolor by Shibasaki. His videos are about painting, and he talks in the background. It's very cute, and I think he draw really well! 

I like how the Japanese content on YouTube is so different from the content in the rest of the world. When I was searching for Japanese content creators, I discovered a video where a young man entered a creepy all-pink messy apartment or something, and I didn't understand anything that was happening. A weird man guided him through what I assume are his collections of children's pink toys. Maybe it was for Halloween? Anyway, I like the diversity of a website such as YouTube, because it has hundreds of hours of content for immersion. That's also where I watch the Japanese TV Shows I like, such as TORE or the Ice Staircase Race.

## Web Articles ニュース記事
I tried doing random researches on the Internet to browse web pages. I ended up reading a Wikipedia page about the roman emperors, and daily weather in Japan. I actually picked up some words, and I was very surprised I could sometimes even get a general idea of what a sentence meant (without using Yomichan). I think I'm getting a bit better at it, and that's awesome.

I also found this awesome website named [New Web Easy](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/article/disaster_rain.html), which rewrites web articles in simpler Japanese so beginners can understand them. I can't thank them enough, because it actually makes it fun to read random stuff now! Also, since it is a website, I can use Yomichan, which saves a ton of time. I really want to start mining words, but on the other hand I am scared of burning out. I may start by getting 1, 2, or 3 new words per day in addition to my current N5 deck in Anki. 

### [最近ほめられていない取材班がほめる大切さを取材してみた](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20221019/k10013863591000.html)

この ニュース記事は 学生と先生の関係についてのものです。I didn't understand everything, but I think the article talked about a "method" which is called 「ほめ育」, which consists in complementing more the your students to have a better relationship with them.

### [人生120年時代の到来！？「アンチエイジング医学」を超速解説](https://www6.nhk.or.jp/nhkpr/post/trailer.html?i=35991)

このニュース記事はアンチエイジング医学についてのものです。I don't think I had access to the whole article because of how short it was, but I understood it as a sort of ad for a longevity medicine that is supposed to allow you to live up to 120 years old.

## Pitch accent training
I also trained my pitch accent using [this test](https://kotu.io/tests/pitchAccent/minimalPairs).

Out of 100 tries, I got:
- 88% the first day
- 94% the second day
- 89% on the third day
