## WJR4 17 Oct. -  24 Oct. 2022

I really need to use more native content in order to learn.
### Yuta's Japanese Guide

I went through a few videos of my man Yuta Aoki and I have to admit it, he explains things quite well. I've taken 2 notes already (which you can see in [[Japanese]]). I'm currently watching the 3rd part of "Yuta's Basic Japanese" and I'm happy to see that he didn't give up on sending e-mails after this one. Great news folks.

### Anki
I continued with 3 new cards per day with Anki, and it is going pretty well. I am learning a lot of vocabulary.

### Browsing the Internet

The main reason why I wasn't able to consume a lot of native content is because I was too busy. (Like actually, no excuses being made). But whenever I had 5 minutes of free time this week, I tried doing random researches on the Internet and to browse the pages. 

I ended up reading a Wikipedia page about the roman emperors, and daily weather in Japan. I actually picked up some words, and I was very surprised I could sometimes even get a general idea of what a sentence meant. I think I'm getting a bit better at it, and that's awesome. That means that I should really continue doing that, in addition to the daily Anki (and Duolingo) sessions. My goal for now would be to get about 30 minutes of Japanese content in per day.
