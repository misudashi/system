### Yuta's Japanese Guide

I went through a few videos of my man Yuta Aoki and I have to admit it, he explains things quite well. I've taken 2 notes already (which you can see in [[Japanese]]). I'm currently watching the 3rd part of "Yuta's Basic Japanese" and I'm happy to see that he didn't give up on sending e-mails after this one. Great news folks.
