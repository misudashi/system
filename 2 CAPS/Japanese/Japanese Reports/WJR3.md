----------
I haven't made that much progress in Japanese this week, because I was focusing on other parts of my life such as hitting my first sessions to the gym, and the beginning of the school year. Next week, though, I'll slowly get back to the nice "1hr/day" habit. I'll keep ya updated on how it goes.
### Calligraphy
I know that calligraphy isn't going to benefit me as much as other things I could be doing instead, but I find it really fun. I wrote 「薫風爽やかな季節を迎え、 貴社に於かれましては 益々ご清栄のことと存じます」which means "As we enter this refreshing season of early-summer breezes, we hope for your continued health and prosperity."

I found this text on [EJLX](https://discord.gg/japanese) through the "handwriting" channel. It is pronounced 「くれぷうさわやかなませつをむかえ、ましゃにおかれましてはますますごせいえいのこととぜんじます」」. I really enjoyed writing it to be honest. 

### Yuta Aoki
I started following Yuta Aoki's Basic Japanese Guide and so far, I really enjoy his vibe. He's pretty obsessed with the "Learn **real** Japanese spoken by **real** people" thing, which he says in every single video I've seen from him so far. I've subscribed to his newsletter, but I'm late by some days, which I'll catch up this week-end. I haven't learned that many things, but it's pretty enjoyable, and I learn some facts here and there about Japanese people. For instance, when he said that Japanese people often take a bath at night (which I don't really care, but you know, that's always a nice little fun fact added to my brain). 

### Duolingo
I have set the habit of doing one Duolingo lesson every day (which corresponds to 10 exp). This way, I keep the streak (40+days as I'm writing this). I don't really know why I continue doing them, but I feel like I can learn **at least** a new word per week using it, even if it's not perfectly optimized.

### Anki
I've reduced the number of new cards per day to 3, because I was feeling like 10 was too much. Don't worry though, I will, of course, get it higher as the weeks pass. But for now, I have other priorities (such as focusing on the gym), which don't give me as much time as I would like. I think I'll stick with 3 new cards per day for a few more weeks, and then when everything in my life is "stabilized", I will increase it to 5 or 6 per day. 

On the other hand, I really enjoy Anki. I feel like it is effective (after all, I'm learning 3 new words or sentences per day!), and it's pretty fun. It takes me about 9 minutes per day (it used to take me 30), so I think about 6 cards per day in a few weeks is fine, for, let's say, 20 to 40 minutes per day on busy days.

### Practicing 平仮名 reading
While I was waiting for a friend to meet me, I thought "why not practicing my reading of Hiragana?". So I took my phone, and I searched for hiragana-written content. I quickly found a nice website which I put a link in [[IIIIIIllIllIlIl]]. I found a story named [Princess Kaguya](https://crunchynihongo.com/hiragana-reading-practice-kaguya). As you can guess, the point isn't to understand what you're reading (which would be fairly hard, given there isn't any 漢字), but instead, to simply read out loud the pronounciation in order to get used to read fast. I saw a bit of improvement after about 40 minutes in, and I have to say it isn't as boring as it seems!
