So that's it ! Here is the first week of my journey on learning Japanese. I already have some *weak weak* basics : I used Duolingo to learn Kana. I have a Anki Mining Deck set up, and I learned +- how to use it. I will be first learning basic Grammar using [Sakubi's Guide](https://sakubi.neocities.org/#) on the topic. When I feel like it is not enough anymore, I will switch on Tae Kim's guide. On the vocabulary part, I'm learning **a lot** everytime I read anything online, pretty much. I also watched the Pitch Tone basic introduction recommended by [Morg](https://morgs.systems).

## Chatting

Today I posted one sentence in a discord server where people speak Japanese. One single sentence. My first sentence in Japanese. I have no bases in Grammar, and I didn't use any in it anyway. I used the vocabulary I already know. Ready for this sentence ? Alright. I wanted to say "Please talk to me". 

[This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945027080037498890/1008769038572327052/unknown.png) is how it ended. Listen. I have **absolutely no idea** how I created this sentence. But alright. Anyway, the answers were pretty funny, and people were surprisingly willing to help me. I was told a lot of sentences, and I was able to add a lot of things into my Anki Deck.

Also I just realized while typing this that so far, I haven't given any context in every single Kanji I put in my deck. I might want to do that now actually.

Morg actually came with a really good analogy, which you can see [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945027080037498890/1008774425501499453/unknown.png). So now I really understand exactly what a Kanji is. And I also understand how wrong I was by building the Kanji deck I'm building right now. So I'll fix that.

## Anki

I downloaded a 2nd deck called 2k/6k which, at first, seemed interesting. But actually, the words weren't that clever, I felt like. So yesterday I only learned 5 new words (which were also a pain to remember, like actually) and today I did 5 others. Now, I put the daily limit of new words to 0. Because I'll be gone next week and I don't want to come back and discover I have 100 cards to do per day until Christmas..

I decided to download a 3rd deck called N5 Tango, which seems more appropriate to my level. You can test it out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pMlJvSrKQOSaiN8sPLdNDvWP31EClxDO/view) if you want. I learned the word West, "What day is it ?", Friday, etc. More interesting than "matchmaker" to me, since I'm a complete beginner... I'll try to get 3 new words tomorrow aswell. Then for the rest of the week, I'll set it to 0 too so I'm O.K. to go.

## Routine
So I'm going to set up a small Japanese Routine to avoid two things :
- Spending the day only learning Japanese, and skipping everything else I wanted to do (yes, it is very time consuming if you don't pay attention to the clock)
- Keep consistency to not get bored after a few weeks

With that said, [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945027080037498890/1008985508032024596/unknown.png) is my Japanese Routine.

It pretty much consists in 
- Anki : for now, the Tango N5 Deck, normally 5 new cards per day.
- Read a few pages of Tae Kim's Grammar Guide Book (the goal being like a chapter per week or something, so really not that time-consuming)
- Immersion for a few minutes. Since I can't yet understand anything that is said, I'll try to understand with the images and stuff like that. I'll also put the subtitles in Japanese. Optionally, I can also put the english subtitles on more immersion (for example watching a Jojo's episode, stuff like that.)

## Tae Kim

I just started using Tae Kim's guide on Japanese and so far I'm really impressed on how he easily explains things I spent 20 hours trying to understand. I wish I read it before ! 

I'm only [this far](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/kanji) though, so we'll see how it goes from now.


Okay ! So I just already learned a lot ! First of all, when you want to use the negative on a noun or a na-adjective, you use じゃない. 

To use the past, you use だった. 

And finally, when you want to use both at the same time, so if you want to say something like "was not", you use じゃなかった.

[Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945027080037498890/1009701618251481098/unknown.png) is a small summary of this chapter.

For now I'll be trying to do the exercises that you can see [here](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/stateofbeing_ex) (4)

## Anime

I just started watching Jojo's to try and catch some cool words. I see that more like a fun way to passively, slightly improve my Japanese. I think it's a great anime to be honest, although I'm only at the beginning. I had already started it a few months ago, but after my first ever dopamine detox, I kind of forgot about it. I think now is a great time to start again, as Japanese kind of gives me an excuse too. I usually don't watch more than 2 episodes at once because I get "bored" easily. It's not that Jojo's is boring, but I don't really like just sitting passively and consuming content without thinking or anything for too long.

Tomorrow, I'm going to start the 2nd part, with Joseph. I hope it will be as good as the first one, but to be honest, it sounds great ! I'll write more on that when I get further into the story.
