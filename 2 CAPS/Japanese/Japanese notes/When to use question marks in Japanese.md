## When should I put a "?" in Japanese ?

In textbooks (Genki, ...), it is often said that "you don't **need** to put a question mark at the end of a sentence".

Then, they often give an example such as 

「トムですか。」[ Is Tom? (Are you Tom?) ].

But often, you do see question marks. For instance, in a dialogue with a friend : 

「日本語が話せますか?」 [ Speak Japanese? (Can you speak Japanese?) ]

So when exactly should you use a question mark ?

**Official/formal text = No question marks.**

**Everything else = Question marks.**
