## The honorific prefixes「お」 and 「ご」

The prefixes お  and ご are used to add politeness to a word.

-   お is used for words with the [[訓読み]] reading.
-   ご is used for words with the [[音読み]] reading.

You can't just decide to add these two prefixes to any word. Some words already have them "built in".
