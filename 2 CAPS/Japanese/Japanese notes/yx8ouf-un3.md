Spoken Japanese: 

### 敬語

- 「はい」(yes)
- 「いえ」or 「いや」(no)

タメロ

- 「うん」 (yes)
- 「ううん」or 「いや」 (no)

Note: 

- Sometimes, you don't even have to answer. You can just nod your head (up and down for yes ; right and left for no).
- You will almost never **hear** 「いいえ」; but you can see it, for example on contexts such as a small quiz or a test:

日本人ですか？

- はい
- いいえ、

And then you would have to circle the first or the second option.
