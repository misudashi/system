## Do not always use 私

In textbooks, it is often said that to introduce yourself, you should say:

「私はジョンです。」

(which is pronounced わたしはじょんです。)

But in reality, if it is clear from the context that you are talking about yourself, you shouldn't use 私. Sometimes, it can even sound annoying. 

You can translate 「私は」 by "As for me, ". so imagine if someone spoke like this:

"As for me, I love to eat croissants. But as for me, I prefer even more baguettes. Oh, by the way, as for me, I am Misudashi." 

So you can just say 「ジョンです。」
