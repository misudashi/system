Greetings everyone, Misudashi here. In this article, we will be learning about the large topic of *Meditation*.
**Please note that** I am not a professional, and I would be very pleased to be corrected by whoever may find mistakes, or someone who has things they would've liked to be added to this article.

Through this page, I will be talking about my personal experience on meditation as a teenager, the scientific benefits behind it, how to start your journey on meditation. I will be starting by commenting on the stereotypes you may hear while starting to meditate.

### **Summary**

- **The stereotypes about meditation and why you shouldn't listen to them**
- **Why should you start meditating**
- **When should you start meditating**
- **How can you start meditating**


### 1 : The stereotypes about meditation and why you shouldn't listen to them

So when I first started meditating, about a month ago, I was scared some people would be sceptical. They were. Of course, doesn't matter what you do in your life, if it's new, there will be people that will criticize you.  Especially when you start **meditating**. 

In our modern society, when you take a step into having a better mental health, people will judge you. You shouldn't listen to them. 

I would like to share a thought I had about this problem recently : You may have noticed that often, when you say "I'm starting to run every day" people that aren't really close to you won't support you. But on the other hand, when you are a really good runner, and you are able to do a marathon, literally everyone around you will compliment you on that.

**People like events. Not process**.
 The event is what you will reach once the process is done. It's the reward. The event is having a better mental health. The process is meditating. 

Another "argument" against meditating is that when you say "Oh, yeah, I do meditate.", people will see you as a Buddhist Monk. Some may even be scared that meditating will "convert" them to Buddhism. That's not the case. Meditating isn't sticked to religions, and it is perfectly fine to meditate if you are not a Buddhist. As a matter of fact, literally anyone could *and should* meditate. I know a lot of Muslims, Christians, Atheists, Buddhists, that meditate daily. 

### 2: Why you should start meditating

There are very few downsides to meditation. The ratio pros/cons is insane. Literally 5 minutes per day. 5 minutes is all it takes to enjoy the benefits listed below.

*The benefits of meditation I, and other people from the [[MOC Self Improvement]] community are, but are not limited to:*

- Being able to handle and manage stress better
- Increasing self awareness
- Helping you focusing on the present moment 
- Concentrating better, faster, and longer
- Increasing creativity, and imagination
- Increasing patience

On my own experience, meditating was game-changing. Before starting my journey, about a month and a half ago from [[2022-08-15]], my mind was so fucked up that I couldn't purely concentrate on anything. My first ever meditating session was supposed to be 3 minutes long. I deleted the app and went on YouTube before it ended. 

I think we can say it improved my patience, since I can do 20 minutes sessions without problems to this day. (which I don't do daily). 

More importantly, and that is the first thing I'm grateful for, it helped me focusing on the present moment. I was able to concentrate better, for longer, and faster. Essentially, before starting to meditate, when I started working on something, I most of the time wasn't paying attention to what I was doing. I didn't know the concept of [Deep Work](https://timelyapp.com/blog/how-to-do-deep-work-effectively).

What you need to realize is that when you start working on something important, you should turn off your phone. Lock your door. Your eyes should never go away from your screen or your book. You should be 100% in it. 

Something really interesting happens when you meditate. Try it. Right now.  **When you finish reading THIS paragraph, close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Focus on it, feel it. Don't think of anything else than the air entering and leaving your body. *DO IT NOW* for 1 minute. Set a timer, and focus on your breathing with your eyes closed**.


Did you notice it ? Did you notice your brain ? Thoughts ? Thoughts appear. You do not control your thoughts. I bet thoughts traveled your mind. You can try again if you want. Thoughts will *appear*. Try to not have any thoughts. Trust me, that's normal. That's what we're working on when we meditate. When you're a beginner, the best way to meditate is to concentrate on your breathing. Everytime you notice you are thinking, draw your attention back on breathing. At first, sometimes, you will spend minutes thinking without noticing. But when you do, stop. When you will be trained enough, it will feel much easier to notice thoughts. And when you will be working, you won't be distracted anymore by your own thoughts. 

**But misu, what about the downsides ?!**
Here is the only thing I noticed that can be seen as a con on my journey :
- You spend 5 minutes a day on something that you, at first, don't think will work.

And to this, I want to say : so what ? What could you possibly lose if you tried meditation ? 5 minutes a day for a week ? What could you win ? Better mental health ? 
There's no doubt that the world would be better if at least everyone tried to meditate everyday for a week.

### 3: When should you start meditating ?

I technically cannot know your age. You could be 13, 17, 21, 31, 52, or even 78 (who knows ?). 

To be honest, I don't really care about your age. In fact, it doesn't matter how old you are, who you are, or whatever excuse you may find, you should start meditating today. Each day, for the rest of your life, and I guarantee you will feel better.

Today. Not tomorrow, not on your next week-end, not next holiday, but now.

### 4: How can you start meditating ?

Okay, so that's where things get a little tricky for me. To succeed on this article, I need you to do what I tell you to do. Not only read it, but do what I say. I will give you a step-by-step guide. I *need* you to follow it. Literally, grab a paper and a pen, and note the following list. Once you're done, I want you to do what's written. Right now, go grab a sheet ! 

- Write this list down on a piece of paper.
- Take your phone
- Go in the App Store, or the Google Play Store or whatever
- Type "Medito". Download the app.
- Once you've downloaded it, it should look something like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945027080037498890/1008664808134029342/IMG_1435.png). If you can't see the screenshot, it's alright, don't worry. I'll try to fix it *asap*.
- Click "Daily Meditation". 
- "Pick a narrator & duration". Select Will (the first one), and "3 minutes". It should look something like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945027080037498890/1008665442564448266/IMG_1436.png).
- Click Begin.
- Follow the narrator's instructions.
- Once you're done with your first ever meditation session, repeat that the day after.
- Set a habit of meditating each day. 
- Once you're comfortable enough with the 3 minutes sessions (wait for at least a week without missing a single day), increase the duration to 5 minutes.
- If you start enjoying meditating, you can also follow the courses (Step 1, Step 2, etc..) the app has. You can explore the app.


#### BONUS : How to set a reliable habit of meditating each day

When I first started meditating, I would just do it whenever I had time to meditate : in boring classes, on my lunch break, ... While this could suit some experimented people, I wouldn't recommend this to beginners.

Instead, what you need to do is meditate every day, at the same time. I would recommend doing so immediately after waking up, since that's something you will be doing every day for the rest of your life. 

When you wake up, start the app, and meditate for 3 or 5 minutes. Close the app, and do what you would normally do on your morning. 

If you want to learn more about setting good habits, I recommend a book called [Atomic Habits](https://1lib.fr/dl/5214617/de8d64). (This link will download the pdf version of the book, but you can also buy it on websites like Amazon.)
