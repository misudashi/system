## Measuring Productivity

I'm listening to a podcast named [How to measure your productivity](https://alifeofproductivity.com/podcast-how-to-measure-your-productivity/). They commented about something that gave me a bit of an idea.

They said, "It is hard to measure your productivity.".

As we all guessed, counting the hours you've worked in a week or a day is not the best option because :
- You tend to overestimate the number by 25%
- Most of the time, it won't be complete deep work as you will have been distracted during the hours you just counted.

The woman then said that measuring tasks in a larger time frame can be a good idea. For instance, if, after a year, she has written the 100 articles she needed to do, she will consider the said year as a productive year. She did put a disclaimer though; 
- If you do this for a shorter period, like a day, you may experience unbalanced statistics: you may have felt productive for one day because you did make a lot of progress by fixing lots of bugs, if you didn't create a new feature, the day will be counted as not productive, even though it was.
- It can be hard to measure how much progress you've made on a task because it will be blurry since you count for a whole year before seeing results.

## The idea
While they were saying this, I thought "why not simply rate your days on a score out of 10 ?"

You would yourself set descriptions like 
- 0 = You didn't do anything productive
- 10 = The whole day was super productive

Then, you would simply sum each day of the week after each week, giving you your score out of 70, while also thinking "Is this what I would rate my week ?" and change the score if you **honestly** feel like it is necessary.

Please note that you need to be loyal to yourself for this to work.

Eventually, you could set milestones like "Have a monthly score above 150 for 2 months".

The pros of this are :
- Your motivation to be productive is only your desire of being satisfied at the end of the month
- Nothing is static: if you feel like you have underrated or overrated some parts of each week, you may change them freely. You are the only judge.
- By constantly improving your weeks, you will eventually simply be happier because you are satisfied with what you did instead of having someone judging them for you.
