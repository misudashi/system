# Thoughts on failure
## Highlights
- We fail if we stop trying to find and develop a meaningful flow, as a union of play and work, not in completing some specific project.
- For this, among other reasons, I define success as the process of bringing play into work such that the world feeds back and sustains that person in play. Failure is when we stop the continued attempts of finding and fostering the conditions for play that ultimately develops a sense of meaning. The mistake is in not adapting or learning.
- Mistakes are a matter of perspective. If they are viewed as ends, then they are failures. If we are without error, it is only because we have never tried.
- Every attempt to connect with the world requires adjustment. Each attempt to reach out in intention or question is a fumbling of sorts. It is not that we do not perceive error, so much as it is the grace with which we fumble, by which there are “no mistakes”. The elegance, integrity, honesty, and attempt to learn from our inevitable misalignments between vision and reality provide a continued path towards mastery.
- "Success is not a line crossed, but instead a flow of finding play in work, a daily weaving of meaning into our lives."

## Thoughts
I think we should enjoy the process instead of the event. Every "failure" is part of the process, and we must enjoy every single one of the moments of it, even the bad ones.

Joshua Field Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus shared a sentence I liked in their book on [[R-Minimalism]]: [[Minimalisme by Joshua Field Miliburn and Ryan Nicodemus]]

"The equation of success is 

**Success = Happiness + Constant Improvement**"
